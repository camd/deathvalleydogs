Chris stayed overnight and we made it to Joe\'s at 6am. The house was dark with no signs of movement. I made a call to his cell and sent a text message. Five minutes later, I get a text saying, \"I\'ll be out in 5 minutes.\" About 10 minutes later, we were on the road to the rendevous point at highway 101 &amp; 152 - the Shell Station in Gilroy.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We arrived early and shortly later, we heard Dan and Stuart on the radio. Fifteen minutes later we heard Greg and Edric who said they would be there in 15 minutes. Still no sign of Cam. We made numerous attempts to contact Cameron on the HAM radio, but still nothing. Then about 10 minutes later, Cameron and Devon drove in about the same time as Greg and Edric...Cam was on the wrong channel. </font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">Shortly later, we were on the road to Death Valley with four Jeeps and the Dodge (also known as W.T. - \"White Trash\"). Most of us have names for our rigs.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We made great time on the road and arrived at the first Death Valley Beer stop at about 3:30pm - The Ghost town of Ballerat. It was great to be back in the desert. It was a balmy 92 degrees, but this would soon change.&nbsp; We posed for the customary group picture.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/11/detail_preview/IMG_0303.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" title=\"The Death Valley Dogs at Ballerat\" width=\"450\" height=\"338\" /></p>\r\n<p>We decided&nbsp; to take highway 190 instead of the dirt trail through the canyon to try to make better time. Then about 30 miles later, we were \"off road\" and ascending fast up the mountain. We made it to Mahogany Camp at about 4:30pm and decided to stay at the lower camp grounds to avoid the other campers. There were just enough camp spots to house all of our rigs and persons...so we owned it that night (and the next).</p>\r\n<p>Everyone got busy working, setting up their tents; then Stuart started making dinner. The tacos were awesome!</p>\r\n<p>After dinner, we got the instruments out and the Death Valley Dogs jam session began...with Greg on acoustic base, Dan, Cam and sometimes Devon on acoustic guitar, Edric on drums (or rubbermaid container) and me on harmonica. We sounded pretty damn good.</p>\r\n<p>We played for several hours while we huddled around the fire. It was about 35 degrees as we were at about 7000 feet in elevation.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the dogs eventually started trickling away to bed as the fire grew weaker and weaker. I finally crashed as well and slept pretty good and even was TOO warm at times.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Saturday, October 10, 2009</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Telescope Peak - Day 2</strong></p>\r\n<p>We all woke up at different times to a very chilly morning; making preparations for the days 14 mile round trip hike.</p>\r\n<p>Breakfast was being prepared as I wrote.</p>\r\n<p>We left for the hike at about 10:30am and since we were at the lower camp ground, we decided to walk / hike / trek up the hill to the&nbsp; entrance to the upper camp site and the official entrance of the hikes starting point. This turned out to be a baaaad idea. The road to the entrance point was long and steep and many of us were burnt out before we even got started. However, we took a break before starting the \"real\" hike and the beginning of the route had only a slight incline, which was a nice break.</p>\r\n<p>The route, which had a well established trail, was steadily changing in levels of incline; mostly increasing, which was difficult at times and the cause for many rest breaks.</p>\r\n<p>After about a half a mile, the trail revealed the opening view of Bad Water Basin, Death Valley...the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below see level. The view got more and more spectacular as we climbed higher and higher.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #000000; font-size: 8pt;\">&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/12/large_thumb/IMG_0305.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We stopped the hike at about noon for lunch at a point where we could see the Panamint Valley floor. After lunch, we continued on and soon got to a point where we could see Death Valley on one side and Panamint Valley on the other. This was a surreal sight and we were at abut 9600 feet in elevation at this point.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We stopped shortly later for another notible rest break. This is the point where Chris developed a cramp in his leg and could not continue on. We gave Chris a HAM radio handheld unit, where he stayed and rested and the rest of us pushed on.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">The trip was taking its tole on me, as well as the elevation. I was having some pretty good chest pains that was causing a little concern, but I was able to control it quite a bit by slowing down my pace and getting in the zone. Soon we would make it to the switchbacks and would traverse about 15 of them before reaching the final 100 yards to the summit. </font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">As the majority of the group rounded the final bend, we saw Edric sitting on top. This gave me a second wind and I increased my pace to almost a run and made it to the summit as well. What a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. &nbsp;</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">The rest of the Death Valley Dogs made it to the top within minutes. We could see for miles...It was an amazing site.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font face=\"&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\">We all posed for pictures with the \"Telescope Peak - 11043 Ft\" sign and enjoyed the moment. </font></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #000000; font-size: 8pt;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/14/large_thumb/IMG_0331.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p>After about 10 minutes or so of taking individual glory shots, Dan pulled out the bag of Jackdog\'s ashes.I immediately started to get teary eyed. And as we all gathered and remembered the purpose of the trip, all eyes became red with tears.</p>\r\n<p>We gathered around Dan and Jackdog as Dan struggled through his tears to try to speak. \"I got no words\" Dan said as he grabbed a handful of JackDog\'s ashes and tossed them in the air toward the Death Valley side of the ridge. Dan then held the ashes toward Greg, and he took a handful; then Cam, then me; until all the guys were holding a piece of Jackdog in his hand.</p>\r\n<p>Dan then emptied the bag of ashes on the side of the ridge, and all of us following suit and tossed their handful of ashes over the ridge. I felt the need to say something and for lack of better words, I simply said, \"To Jack,\" realizing the moment I said it that it seemed stupid and wanted to change it to \"Welcome Home, Jack.\"</p>\r\n<p>No one else said anything as the moment overwhelmed us all. Even Joe was taken by the moment and he had only met Jackdog once before. But Jackdog was that kind of dog. You instantly loved him the moment you saw him. He always greeted you with a wagging tail and a smile.</p>\r\n<p>We gathered ourselves and set up the tripod for a group picture; then picked up our packs and started the descent.</p>\r\n<p>For me the descent was much easier that the climb, although for some of the guys, it was harder on the knees and quads. The last of us started down the mountain and the group almost immediately split up between the fast, medium and slower hikers (at least for the downhill part).</p>\r\n<p>As we got to the lower part of the switchback, right before we picked up Chris, I saw a huge buck on the trail about 25 yards in front of Greg. I tried to get Greg\'s attentions without spooking the deer and he eventually turned around and saw the buck take off up the mountain. It was at least a 6 to 8 pointer. It seemed strange to see a deer that big at that elevation, mostly because there were not many level spots for him to bed down.</p>\r\n<p>Dan was feeling sick from the altitude and had a bad headache, which got better as he got further down. Joe was bothered by the decend which caused his quads to tire quickly, but was able to push forward as it sometimes got easiers as the incline leveled out on occasion.</p>\r\n<p>As we reached near the bottom the mountain, moving closer to camp; dusk brought a beautiful sunset, which was a nice ending to the hike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: #000000; font-size: 8pt;\"><img src=\"http://www.deathvalleydogs.com/system/images/15/large_thumb/IMG_0364.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" /></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"null\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0pt; line-height: normal; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After the last of us got back to camp, everyone was fried. But we started to make our steak dinner...we earned it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The regulator on Dan\'s grill was not working properly so we threw the steaks on the grill attached to the firepit. The steaks came out great and everyone gobbled them up since we worked up quite an appetite on the hike.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">After dinner, we just sat around the fire and talked and joked. We started dropping out one by one to go to bed until eventually, it was all quiet.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I couldn\'t get to sleep that night for some reason. I was extremely warm despite the 35 degree temperature outside. My new zero degree sleeping bag really keeps you toasty. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Sunday, October 11, 2009</span></em></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">Telescope Peak - Day 3 - Final</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">As morning came, I got up about 6:30am and begain gathering my supplies and packing up. I had everything packed up pretty early and Chris did too. The guys all eventually got up and made themselves oatmeal for breakfast and then we started to clean up to get ready to go. We made good time and got started out about 9:30am with the planned stop to the Charcoal Kilns about a mile down the road.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">The guys convinced me to dig out my harmonica case to play with Dan &amp; guitar in the kilns. We arrived and got out the instruments and walkin in. I could immediately hear the reverberating sound off the round walls.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\">I got out a harmonica and just made up a song from scratch and Dan picked up the tune and played with me. It really sounded great.

While this first Death Valley trip was still in\r\nits planning stages, I remember us talking about mine shafts we\'d find.\r\nI also remember talking about \"Bad Air.\" Bad air is when toxic gases\r\nthat are heavier than air settle into mine shafts, or caves for that\r\nmatter. They lay low on the ground, so when you\'re walking in, you\r\ndon\'t notice anything. But all the while, you\'re kicking up the \"Bad\r\nAir\" into the passage behind you. Then when you go to leave, you start\r\nwalking through it, pass out and die. Skidoo was really cool.</p>\r\n<p>We hiked around outside for a bit and noticed a couple\r\nparts where it looked like sink holes had collapsed. Reep was running\r\naround wild and having a great time with it. We found the main entrance\r\nand saw a steel net that had been ripped open. We smiled, grabbed our\r\nflashlights and walked in. When I saw the ancient timbers supporting\r\nthe walls of the passageway, my mind flashed back to the collapsed\r\nsink-holes we saw outside. Those weren\'t sink-holes. I recall feeling\r\nmuch more eerie at that point. The thought of the mine shaft collapsing\r\non us seemed like a pretty greusome way to <img src=\"/system/images/8/large_thumb/untitled_3_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: left;\" />go.  And, in a way, it made it more fun.</p>\r\n<p>We\r\nhad all been in the IXL cavern back home in Santa Cruz (Hell Hole, it\'s\r\ncalled) so spelunking was nothing new to us. In fact, I believe that\r\nwas when I first met Dan. Spelunking was, yes, claustrophobic and\r\nstrange. But it\'s also really, really fun. There\'s just something so\r\nprimal about being in the cold cold ground. And, yes, there\'s a certain\r\nthrill to it. It\'s kind of like skydiving, just not as safe. But\r\nI&nbsp;digress...</p>\r\n<p>As we got deeper into the mountain, the\r\npassages became tighter and tighter. And, unlike IXL which was\r\nnaturally formed and self-supporting, these spots were supported by 2\r\nto 3 foot sections of 2x4s, 4x4s and logs! At several points, you could\r\nshine your light at about a 45 degree angle upwards and see for 100\r\nfeet. The miners had sliced wafers of the mountain out to get their\r\nprecious minerals. I think Skidoo was predominantly Borax mining. All\r\nthat work and risk for soap?<img src=\"/system/images/9/large_thumb/untitled_4_tif_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: right;\" /></p>\r\n<p>As\r\nwe climbed higher into the mountain, we eventually saw natural light.\r\nWe crawled to the light only to discover that the hole had been netted\r\nshut. This one was still tightly secure. I remember looking at Dan with\r\nan, \"Oh shit\" and laughed. I thought about the logs supporting the\r\nwhole hill and bad air and all that and thought, \"Gee, it\'d be nice to\r\nget <img src=\"/system/images/10/large_thumb/untitled_11.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"229\" style=\"float: left;\" />out\r\nthis way rather than go back.\" We scouted around a bit more and found\r\nanother location that hadn\'t been closed. It was a thin sliver of an\r\nopening that I had to crawl on my belly to get through. For some\r\nreason, right as I was half way out, I had this vision of an earthquake\r\nhappening and the rock crushing me in half. \"Whew.\" Once my feet\r\nfollowed me out, I felt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Hollow Mountain was really cool.  But I admit, it kinda gave me the creeps.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 351px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 356px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 351px; top: 1241px;\">save</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 356px; top: 209px;\">save</span></p>',2),(6,'2010-05-20 17:58:49','2011-04-15 20:40:13',2,1,'Funeral Mountains','Dude, we should probably be moving faster.','<p>\"Dude, we should probably be moving faster.\"<img src=\"/system/images/3/large_thumb/funeral_mtns_hike_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"222\" style=\"float: right;\" /><br /><br />Cameron, squatted down with his camera to his eye said \"Huh. This cactus is really cool looking. \"<br /><br />\"No. Really. I think we need to haul ass.\" Big puffy clouds had been growing darker by the minute. The steep trail up the canyon wasn\'t getting any less steep, and no matter how much I stared at the little dotted line on the USGS map I still couldn\'t pin point our exact location. But I was beginning to think it was a lot less further along than I\'d thought before.<br /><br />Cameron stood up, satisfied with his photo op. of the cactus. \"OK.\" He said. Let\'s go.\"<br /><br />In the failing light of the funeral mountains, monolithic head walls above us gave no hint as to where the trail might be. To our right, the gorge dropped into near darkness. Several mines were supposed to be up ahead, and I marveled at the thought of dusty 19th century miners negotiating the precipitous twists and turns of these paths, loading ore cars to travel down the unbelievably steep tramway to the bottom of the mountain. One still hung from a single cable a hundred feet over the canyon, dangling where it stopped in mid-span more than a century ago.<br /><br />It started to rain.<br /><br />We pushed on, gloom wrapping around us. The whole hike was only about four miles, but the steepness of the trail, the switchbacks up the side of the rocky gorge made me think: if we lost the trail in the darkness, we were screwed.<br /><br />Cameron was no longer looking for things to photograph.<br /><br />By the time we reached the last of the mines, it was full night, and a light rain fell steadily. We examined a small cavern. Bits and pieces of old things, miners things, were spread here and there. \"Well, I guess we could always spend the night in this place, if we had to. At least we\'d be dry.\" Cameron pondered the thought. He figured the same as me: we\'d survive the night, but it would suck.<br /><br />The key to whether or not we\'d spend the next 12 hours huddled in a dusty abandoned mine shaft high in the Funeral Mountains was a tiny cairn of rocks, marking where the trail turned north, skirting a thin path around the massive head wall above.<br /><br />\"Dude. I found it!\"<br /><br />Our headlamps cast only the palest arcs as we pressed on into the rain and dark.<br /><br />It would have been different if we\'d started earlier in the day, but it was nearly three o\' clock when Greg and Stuart had dropped us off in the parking lot below Keene Wonder mine. The plan, conceived by Greg, was simple: two guys hike through while two guys drive around and meet them on the other side.<br /><br />It would become the signature of our trips, these \"through-hikes\", ultimately refined to an art form: linking trails through canyons choked with brush, finding a finger of ridge to descend by moonlight, the swig of Tequila at the beginning, an icy Corona with lime waiting at the end, steaks sizzling, feet sore, all smiles and stories and \"I can\'t believe we just did that\" all around.<br /><br />Ultimately, 2-meter radios and GPS would be added to mix. But for now, it was just Cam and I, a slightly damp USGS map and one small walkie-talkie -- the kind you tried to play with as a kid but quickly discovered that they totally sucked.<br /><br />Greg and Stuart had the other walkie-talkie.<br /><br />They also had Reep-i-cheep.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/38/large_thumb/repacheep_232.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"223\" style=\"margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: left;\" />I\'d considered bringing her on this hike, but her on-again-off-again limp had recently returned. So instead of hiking, the goofy dog rode. Considering what the hike had turned out to be it was probably a good thing.<br /><br />After a while the trail turned back to the east, continuing along the mountain\'s right flank and, thankfully, beginning to level out.&nbsp; As we plodded along, discussing in low tones how the worst appeared to be behind us, I must have inadvertently pressed and then released the radio\'s &ldquo;send&rdquo; button because I suddenly heard Greg\'s voice crackle thinly from the tiny speaker.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can hear you! I can totally hear you!&rdquo;<br /><br />Greg told us he was parked in my truck on a road near a ridge top and Reep-i-cheep was with Stuart taking shelter from the rain nearby in an old miner\'s shack.&nbsp; I began to think he couldn\'t be very far from our location.&nbsp; How else could the crappy walkie-talkies actually be talking to each other?&nbsp; Then I saw what appeared to be a set of running lights across the canyon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dude, flash the headlights.&rdquo;&nbsp; They flashed.<br /><br />In another twenty minutes we had crossed the canyon and, navigating by crappy walkie-talkie, finally made contact with Greg somewhere near the ghost town of Chloride City. It was a glorious reunion.<br /><br />Stuart decided it was too dark and wet to make dinner at camp. That, and the fact he felt our epic journey earned us a hot meal in a warm, dry place, led us to pile into the truck and make east towards asphalt.<br /><br />And that is how our first through-hike ended at a restaurant in Beatty, with drinks all around.<br /><br />Stuart was right.&nbsp; We did earn it.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"padding: 1px 4px; position: absolute; -moz-appearance: tooltip; color: #000000; z-index: 10000; cursor: pointer; left: 430px; top: 228px;\">save</span></p>',1),(7,'2010-05-20 18:03:21','2011-04-15 20:40:00',1,1,'Funeral Mountains','Late in the afternoon, we began hiking up the Funeral Mountains...','<p>My memory on some parts of this is a little fuzzy now, as it was\r\nalmost 11 years ago. I\'ll probably leave a few things out,\r\naccidentally. But as I recall, we didn\'t start this hike till about 3\r\nin the afternoon. I think we had been looking around Artists Palette\r\nand decided to go over there. We talked about how we had the topo and\r\nit didn\'t look that far and would be kind of fun for a couple of us to\r\nhike to a certain point and the others would drive around and pick the\r\nhikers up. I knew right away that I wanted to hike this. I think\r\nsomeone said, \"So, who\'s up for it.\" I said, \"I\'ll go.\" and so did Dan.\r\nGreg nodded and said, \"OK, we\'ll meet you at this point,\" pointing to a\r\nlocation on the map where a road came to an end.</p>\r\n<p>So\r\nDan and I set off. I remember that it was uphill. A LOT uphill. We were\r\nclimbing and climbing and climbing. It was a really beautiful hike.\r\nThere were cool wild flowering cacti which looked pretty cool. I got a\r\npicture, even. And there were lots of mine shafts. Early on, we saw a\r\nfew mining structures, one of which had a cable that went across to a\r\npart of the hillside like a tyrolean traverse.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/4/large_thumb/funeral_mtns_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"230\" style=\"border: 1px solid black; float: left; margin-right: 5px;\" />Dan\r\ndid all the navigating. I am (as everyone knows) clueless when it comes\r\nto navigation. One of my favorite pictures is of Dan\'s back looking at\r\nthe map and there\'s a huge expanse of desert in front of him. I just\r\nlove that picture because it pretty much described how we felt all day.\r\n\"Hmm, I think we\'re right here...\" I was pretty sure Dan would find our\r\nway through. I just did my best to keep a cheerful disposition.</p>\r\n<p>As\r\nthe afternoon progressed, we noticed rain clouds were chasing us. They\r\nlooked a little nasty, so we went as fast as we could. Plus, it was\r\nstarting to get dark. The trail was vague enough that it was getting\r\nhard to follow in the dark. When I stopped to take another picture of a\r\nflower or something, Dan said, \"Dude, we\'d really better keep moving.\r\nIt\'s getting dark.\" We started to scout different mine shafts, saying,\r\n\"well, we could stay there tonight if we had to.\"</p>\r\n<p>The\r\nrain started. It was very light. We were being caught by the rain, but\r\nit wasn\'t heavy enough to make the ground slippery or truly miserable.\r\nI was wearing a t-shirt, and had a flannel in my backpack. I remember\r\nnot wanting to take the flannel out in case we had to sleep in a cave,\r\nI\'d have something dry to wear. Plus, the climb was hard enough that it\r\nkept my core warm. I did, however, remember feeling my arms and the\r\nskin was cold and wet to the touch, yet I was comfortable.</p>\r\n<p>Well,\r\ndarkness finally set in totally. We were just cresting the top and\r\ntrying to look for Greg and Stuart. Luckily, the trail was pretty\r\nestablished at this point, so we could follow, even in the dark with\r\nflashlights. We had these shitty little CB handhelds that BARELY had\r\nline of sight range. We tried to contact Greg and Stuart, but got\r\nnothing.</p>\r\n<p>I remember walking in the dark along the\r\ntrail and seeing some headlights driving perpendicular to our trail\r\nfrom the left. Then they stopped. I said, \"Is that them?\" Dan said, \"I\r\ndon\'t know.\" Then he pointed his mag-light at them and flashed it a\r\ncouple times. To our great relief and shouts, they flashed back. As we\r\ngot closer, we tried the radio again and finally got them. I think we\r\nsaid a lot of things like, \"HOLY SHIT!\" etc...</p>\r\n<p>That\r\nnight we decided, rather than cooking at a camp, to go down to Beatty and get some steaks at a restaurant. It was\r\ngreat. It felt so surreal to be in a restaurant after hiking through\r\nwhat we did. It was an amazing hike and I feel it really solidified my\r\nfriendship with Dan. Ever since then we\'ve had an understanding that\r\ngoes beyond what a lot of friends have.</p>',1),(8,'2010-05-20 18:09:11','2011-04-15 20:38:57',1,2,'Panamint City','Greg, Dan and I blitzed up and over the saddle near Sentinal Peak and down into Johnson Canyon.','<ul>\r\n<li>Lush canopy trail</li>\r\n<li>Panamint City</li>\r\n<li>Guys on ATVs</li>\r\n<li>Sentinel Peak (from below)</li>\r\n<li>Hungry Bill\'s Ranch</li>\r\n<li>Road Head Camp</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This was a great hike. It was hard as hell, but awesome. I only remember fragments now. I remember we all had double water-bottle fanny packs for the hike. They worked pretty well, except that they had limited storage for food, etc. Part of the hike led us up a narrow path through a canopy of vines. We stopped there for lunch. I remember eating oranges and banana flavored power bars. Greg mentioned that nothing banana \"flavored\" ever actually tasted like bananas. I had to admit he was right.<br /><br />Further on up in Panamint City, we stopped again under a huge smoke stack. We saw some of the homes that the miners had. They consisted of 3 mud and rock walls, presumably covered with a wood roof at the time. Just big enough for someone to lay down. Dan said that in its heyday, Panamint City sported 50 shooting deaths in 4 years (or something like that). I guess the gun was pretty much law up there. That kinda blew me away. While there, we met some guys on ATVs coming through. They asked us how far we were going. We said all the way through to Johnson Canyon on the other side. They seemed a little skeptical. Hah!<br /><br />Originally, we had intended to go to the top of Sentinel peak. But our time was running short. We still had a long way to go to get to camp. So Dan told Greg to set an agressive pace. We did our best to keep up with him, but the fucker pretty much left us in the dust. It was a brutal pace. By the time we were within 100 yards of the crest of the saddle, Dan and I were nearing the point of exhaustion. We put our arms around each other and practically carried each other the rest of the way up.<br /><br />At the top, we took another rest. Greg said, \"This would be a good place for a USGS marker.\" Then, \"Oh, hey. There it is!\" We opted not to go up Sentinel peak. Mostly because it was getting late. Not because we were too tired or anything. Nope, we could have done it easy. Seriously... No, seriously.<br /><br />So we headed down into Johnson Canyon. On the way down, we were sliding down loose shale. We took as much care as possible so we didn\'t twist an ankle or anything. But I remember we ended up kind of skiing down it trying not to be directly below one another so as not to take an ankle buster. As we descended, we saw the lush area of Hungry Bill\'s Ranch. There\'s a spring there, so there is a lot of vegitation.<br /><br />What we hadn\'t planned on was just how much vegitation. It was clogged with it. There was no good trail around it. The trail would go to the left of the brush, then cut across on hands and knees trail through the brush, then pick up on the other side for a few. We tried hiking off the trail, but the walls got so steep that out footing became dicey. Dan tried to just machette his way through the brambles, but with only a Swiss Army knife, it was slow and arduous. He eventually gave up.<br /><br />We\'d find the trail, then lose it, then find it, then lose it. Hours of that. Reep would be under our feet trying to find the right way. I can\'t tell you how annoying it is to have a dog underfoot when you\'re so tired you\'re barely still walking.<br /><br />It got darker and darker, and eventually, started to level off. We finally raised Skip on the radio and he said he had a camp site and was just waiting for us to arrive. I remember being so damn happy to hear from them. Skip came out and met us for the last couple hundred yards or so. And just as we were about to get back to camp, Greg twists his ankle to hell. Seemed so damn ironic. I guess that\'s when it happens, though. When you think you\'re home free. We were all just happy it happened there and not up at the top of Johnson Canyon. That would have made the hike much more interesting.<br /><br />When we finally got to camp, we drank many beers. I think we had steak and baked potatoes. Can\'t quite recall, but I know it tasted damn good. I slept very well that night.</p>',3),(9,'2010-05-20 18:16:09','2011-04-15 20:38:41',1,1,'Badwater','Is that water up ahead?','<p>As I watched Dan and Greg drive off, a cloud of dust blew away\r\nperpendicular to their travel. That was always what you hoped for while\r\ndriving in Death Valley. Especially if you were driving behind another\r\nrig. A cross wind meant you weren\'t breathing the dust kicked up by the\r\nlead vehicle.</p>\r\n<p>I turned to Stuart and he was looking across Badwater at the\r\nhills in the distance. We were standing near Shorty\'s grave. We\'d\r\ndecided that we\'d go ahead and hike across Badwater itself. Go as low\r\nas you can go in this hemisphere.</p>\r\n<p>He said, \"You know, it only\r\nlooks like about 20 minutes from here...\" I laughed. He was right. It\r\ndidn\'t look like 8 miles. It looked like you\'d start wandering that\r\ndirection and be there in about, yes, 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Dan and Greg\r\nwent to drop off one of the vehicles. They\'d be back in about 20\r\nminutes. But it would take us far longer to walk that 8 miles.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nhad been an amazing trip so far. We\'d done so many things. This,\r\nhowever, seemed like it would be a kind of pinnacle. As it turned out,\r\nit truly was. This was, and I think still is, the hardest hike I\'ve\r\never done.</p>\r\n<p>I remember telling Stuart that I was studying Tae\r\nKwon Do. It was actually a big deal to tell him. I\'m not the kind of\r\nperson that keeps secrets. I usually end up blabbing everything about\r\nmyself to my friends. But this one, I decided to keep to myself for 6\r\nmonths. I wanted to make sure I was going to stick with it before I\r\nwent bragging to my friends that I was going to learn Tae Kwon Do. But\r\nI had received my first colored belt just prior to the trip, so I felt\r\nI had proven to myself I would stick with it. It felt good to finally\r\ntell someone.</p>\r\n<p>Soon after, Dan and Greg came back in the Scout.\r\nThey were talking about those damn washes on the West Side Highway. The\r\nwater comes through from the alluvial fans in little rivulets across\r\nthe highway. The result is small trenches across the road about 1 foot\r\nwide and 7 or 8 inches deep. Just enough to knock the hell out of your\r\nvehicle. They had hit one hard and gave the Scout a good slam.</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\ndecided to leave Reepacheep in one of the vehicles because she wasn\'t\r\nwalking so well. I think her paws were sore from the gravel she wasn\'t\r\nused to.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/6/large_thumb/badwater_hike_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"225\" style=\"float: right;\" />We set off and started joking that it looked like the\r\nother side was about \"20 minutes from here.\" The ground itself was\r\nsurprisingly spongy. It was sort of like a chocolate chip cookie that\r\nwas crispy on the outside, and chewy inside. My boots crunched through\r\nthe thin shell at the top and sponged into the soft earth beneath. Very\r\nweird, but also very cool.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/5/large_thumb/badwater_hike_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"222\" style=\"float: left;\" />As we continued to walk, the clouds\r\nin the sky reminded us that there was occasionally a bit of moisture in\r\nDeath Valley. The sky above the hills were amazing to look at in all\r\ndirections. The spongy groud, however, slowly transitioned into\r\nsomething altogether more moist. The further we went, the muddier it\r\ngot. The treads on my boots were caked with it as I continued to walk.\r\nI could feel the weight every step I took. As we continued on, the mud\r\nbecame deeper and deeper. Each step I took was not \"lifting\" my foot,\r\nbut \"pulling\" it free of the mud. The effort, after a few miles, was\r\nintense. I would stop for short rests as we went and I realized that\r\nthe longer I waited, the deeper I sunk. The faster you kept moving, the\r\nless you would sink and so the less you\'d have to pull to get your foot\r\nto the next stride. But the fatigue was incredible, yet it still looked\r\nlike \"20 minutes from here.\"</p>\r\n<p>I looked back to see Stuart close\r\nbehind me, clearly not enjoying his fatigue. I said, \"You\'re really\r\nliving now, huh?\" I laughed, but I don\'t think he felt like joining me\r\nin that laugh. He acknowledged me and just kept plugging along. What\r\nelse could we do? We\'d come too far to go back. The only choice was to\r\ngo on.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/7/large_thumb/badwater_hike_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"260\" style=\"float: right;\" />I turned around at one point and the sky was just\r\nbreathtaking. I decided it was worth sinking a couple inches into the\r\nmud to get that shot. So I pulled out my camera and snapped a few\r\npictures. One, in particular, is my favorite. You can see all our sets\r\nof footprints in the mud beneath a sky peppered with rain clouds as you\r\nlook back to the Panamind range. Satisfied, I put my camera back in my\r\npack and began trudging again.</p>\r\n<p>I remember cursing Greg because\r\nhe was waaaay ahead of the rest of us. He\'s just a great hiker. I can\'t\r\ndeny it. I would like to say that it was easier for him because he\r\nweighs less than&nbsp;I do. But mostly it\'s that he\'s got an amazing\r\nconstitution. Fucker.</p>\r\n<p>A little further on, I saw something I\r\ntruly did not expect. The glare of the what sun there was on water. My\r\nmind quickly did some calculations: Dirt + Water = Mud. Dirt +\r\nMORE&nbsp;Water = DEEPER Mud. And if it was completely submersed, then the\r\nbottom of that water was likely a slog of strange and unpleasant goo. I\r\nthought of my camera with my Pulitzer winning photos. If I had to swim\r\nthrough that water, my camera was toast. But what if it was too shallow\r\nto actually swim through, yet the mud was thick enough to be... a bog?\r\nHmm.</p>\r\n<p>I admit, I was nervous for about 5 good minutes, then\r\nfigured, \"What the fuck. What\'s the worst that could happen? I\'d die?\r\nI\'ve had it coming for years... Plus, Greg will die first cause he\'s in\r\nthe lead...Fucker.\"</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, when we got to the water,\r\nit did not produce an increase in mud. In fact, the water was a god\r\nsend. There was an icy layer of salt at the bottom of the water. All\r\nfresh water has SOME salt in it. And when the lake that once filled\r\nDeath Valley evaporated, the salt couldn\'t evaporate with it, so it\r\njust stayed down there. That\'s actually what makes up the Devil\'s Golf\r\nCourse. Just brown salt instead of white salt. This stuff was all\r\nwhite. And the water itself was completely saturated with salt. It was\r\nso lousy with salt that it felt like gasoline on your fingers.\r\nFortunately, it was only 2 deep where we walked through. As it splashed\r\nmy hands and legs, then dried, the salt looked like white paint. I was\r\nhappy that I was wearing shorts. I think walking through that with\r\npants must have felt a little ugly.</p>\r\n<p>But the good part was that\r\nthe mud was gone. The going in the water was MUCH MUCH easier. I looked\r\nback at Stuart and he was smiling. I\'d almost say \"giddy.\" I know *I*\r\nfelt a whole lot better.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps another mile of that and we\r\nwere on the other side. We got there and all hugged. I looked down at\r\nmy legs and they had salt crystals forming on the hairs. They felt like\r\nVelcro when they touched.</p>\r\n<p>We met the road where the Ranger was\r\nparked. A little tourist parking lot where people can hang out at -282\r\nfeet. Greg said that some people saw him coming to the road and asked\r\nhim, \"How far out did you go?\" Greg said, \"I came from the other side.\"\r\nApparently they didn\'t look like they believed him. Oh well... This was\r\nOUR day. OUR hike. We didn\'t need anyone to believe us. We did it. Now\r\nit was time for some beers.</p>',4),(10,'2010-05-20 18:20:19','2011-04-15 20:38:20',5,1,'Badwater','It was the morning of my thirtieth birthday. This trip happened for this reason. This hike. This trek across the valley floor.','<p>\"Herm... it doesn\'t look that far.\" That was the first thought. Almost disappointed, but not wanting to admit it.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas the morning of my thirtieth birthday. This trip happened for this\r\nreason. This hike. This trek across the valley floor. A moment of\r\ntransition. A moment to claim as my own. \"What did you do for your\r\nbirthday?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, I walked across Death Valley.\"</p>\r\n<p>Cool.</p>\r\n<p>\"I stood at the lowest possible point in the Northern Hemisphere.\"</p>\r\n<p>Yeah. It sounded good to me.</p>\r\n<p>But\r\nthis... this didn\'t look like a challenging hike. It looked like a\r\npleasant stroll... I figured, what, twenty minutes to cross?</p>\r\n<p>Greg\r\nand I had often poured over maps of Death Valley in the past. The idea\r\nof the place always scared me, lets be honest. The very names conjured\r\nhazards of mythic proportions: Dante\'s View, Funeral Mountains, Hell\'s\r\nGate, Starvation Canyon, Coffin Peak, Furnace Creek, Dry Bone Canyon,\r\nand the subtle, Badwater.</p>\r\n<p>Badwater. That was the one that\r\nalways stuck in my mind. That one spot on the map grounded the\r\ndramatic, sweeping scope of the valley. A spot that denoted despair.\r\nNot a place to stop and marvel, but a place to move on away from.\r\nBadwater.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like it\'ll take about twenty minutes,\" Dan\r\nsaid squinting into the rising sun. The winds that had plagued us the\r\nnight before were gone. There were dark clouds hanging above the\r\nPanamint Range behind us, but the Funeral Mountains before us looked\r\nclear.</p>\r\n<p>We were all in good humor as we stood on the West Side\r\nHighway looking east. The only debate was whether to bring the\r\ncamcorder or not, but I opted not to. Cam said he was going to bring\r\nhis camera. Luckily it still seemed to work despite that it took a\r\nnasty ding the afternoon before, during our repelling adventure.\r\nBesides, I was pretty sure the other three were pretty fed up with\r\nhaving a camcorder in their face. Plus, there still was a chance of\r\nrain.</p>\r\n<p>\"So what do you want to do if we hit water?\" Greg\r\nshrugged. Deal with it, was the unspoken attitude. And with that we\r\nstarted out, laughing and working out the morning kinks. I took some\r\npictures of the dogs, and then slowly we all started to separate. I\r\nbranched out to the south, Cam to the north, Greg setting a quick,\r\nlight pace as is his way, up ahead.</p>\r\n<p>The silence of the valley\r\nwas magnificent. The view was unbroken by anything that gave a scale of\r\ndistance. There was just a breeze rumbling in my ears. Without any\r\nfamiliar distractions I became introspective, as was the idea for the\r\nday. I wandered off course for a good while until I felt completely\r\nalone. I found a good spot to lie down at, spread my arms out wide and\r\nstared at nothing but the clouds that drifted overhead. I had thought\r\nthat this place might become oppressive, make me edgy. But instead I\r\nfound a calming peace. I felt as if I were lying at the center of the\r\nuniverse. Everything revolved around me without touching me. I couldn\'t\r\nstop smiling. It was such a wonderful present. Happy Birthday, I told\r\nmyself.</p>\r\n<p>As I stood to resume my hike, I got such a head-rush.\r\nThe whole bowl of the valley seemed to sweep up and away from me.\r\nWhether it was from being two hundred eighty two feet below sea level,\r\nor the topography, or the atmosphere, I didn\'t know. But the Funeral\r\nMountains still looked about twenty minutes away.</p>\r\n<p>The ground\r\nslowly turned from a dusty hard pack to a soft plain that was a\r\npleasure to walk on. My knees and ankles, and especially my flat arches\r\nsighed with relief. While not dramatic, this was turning into a\r\npleasant stroll. I had to keep an eye on the Funeral cliffs, which\r\ndenoted where the trucks were parked, and maybe one eye on the shimmer\r\nthat came from the valley floor, which may be the lake, or just a heat\r\nmirage.</p>\r\n<p>A chilly wind brought a few sprinkles of rain. Just\r\nenough to roll down my sleeves and justify not bringing the camcorder.\r\nThe idea of rain seemed doable, but a downpour would probably turn the\r\nsoft turf to mud, and that was not something I wanted to look forward\r\nto.</p>\r\n<p>And speaking of turf, we crossed a demarcation line and\r\nthe sparse shrubs and copse of weeds vanished. Our feet just broke the\r\nground crust leaving slight indentations. Again, pleasant.</p>\r\n<p>Greg slowed down and Cameron and I regrouped with Dan once more.</p>\r\n<p>\"Looks like about, oh, say, twenty minutes to the other side,\" Dan laughed.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\npointed to the shimmer up ahead, \"That mirage sure does look like\r\nwater.\" Greg agreed and we shifted our route a little more south.</p>\r\n<p>It\r\nwas water all right. Water and waves. I knew that this had been too\r\neasy. Now would come the challenge. Would it be safe? Would we have to\r\nwade, or even swim? There was no way to tell. We could only trudge on.</p>\r\n<p>\"It\r\ncouldn\'t be all that deep, could it?\" I asked aloud to no one. With my\r\nconcentration on the distance I failed to note that we crossed another\r\nground demarcation line. It was a darker one this time. The crust was\r\nthinner and the soft pack underneath wetter. \"Whoa\" Cameron slipped and\r\ncaught himself. I felt my boots become heavier as mud clotted between\r\nthe treads of my boots, then to the soles, in larger clumps. Hopefully,\r\nit would not get worse...</p>\r\n<p>It got worse.</p>\r\n<p>We were all\r\nside by side then as we slogged through, becoming more and more aware\r\nof each step we took. I thought it was more of an annoyance,\r\nspeculating that once we hit the water our troubles would really begin.</p>\r\n<p>The\r\namount of mud caked to my boots had become troubling. Damn things were\r\ngetting heavy. It broke my pacing and required more energy than I\r\nwanted. I felt it in my thighs the most. And I had to begin to\r\nconcentrate. And it was getting deeper. My feet sloshed around as my\r\ntoes disappeared underneath the mud. I started to hear sucking sounds\r\nwhen I brought each foot up, and squelching sounds when my foot came\r\ndown. I was definitely annoyed. Even Greg had begun to slow down. Dan\'s\r\nface had become set, and Cameron, deep in the experience, looked like\r\nhe was in awe - like a kid experiencing snow for the first time.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\nremember turning and looking behind us and seeing the straight tracks\r\nof footprints that lead from across the valley floor. Cameron stopped\r\nto take the picture. I thought then, as I still do now, that it is a\r\nwonderfully symbolic shot and am proud to have been part of it.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately,\r\nthat pride quickly evaporated as we trudged against the mud. I was\r\nreduced to a snails crawl. Each step took effort. Signs of fatigue were\r\nshowing. I could no longer feel my toes, then the balls of my feet.\r\nEveryone else was having trouble too, but it became apparent that I was\r\nstruggling the most.</p>\r\n<p>I was losing my happy thought.</p>\r\n<p>Ahead, the expanse of mud seemed to stretch for miles, ending only with a far greater obstacle, the lake. Badwater.</p>\r\n<p>My\r\nthighs were trembling now, burning with fatigue. Some times when I\r\nstepped down, I could not feel any solid ground, just depthless mud\r\nsucking me down. I had to immediately shift my weight and wrench my\r\nback foot up without loosing my boot to the gripping mud. Then repeat.\r\nAnd repeat. Then...</p>\r\n<p>I was straining hard. And I hadn\'t gone\r\nanywhere. A prevailing sense of helplessness descended upon me. I did\r\nnot know if I could make it. What then? I mean, they would not be able\r\nto carry me out, right? And the idea of the hike was my idea. Failure\'s\r\nheavy hammer pounded me with alacrity.</p>\r\n<p>Splosh-suck-splosh-suck</p>\r\n<p>None of us could stop in fear of sinking. Mud was over my boots. Needed to rest. Just a moment. Sinking. Must move. So hard now.</p>\r\n<p>Suck-groan-splosh-groan-suck</p>\r\n<p>Dan was concerned with my progress. He slowed so I wouldn\'t be left behind. \"I\'m getting worried,\" I remember telling him.</p>\r\n<p>\"Just keep going.\"</p>\r\n<p>But\r\nto where? More mud? Deeper mud? Attitude has so much bearing when you\r\nare hiking. It is the most dominating force of momentum. And I was in\r\ncritical danger of losing mine.</p>\r\n<p>I don\'t know if Cameron said\r\nit, or I said it back to him, or whether simply remembered his words in\r\nmy head... but his voice, once again declared to me, \"You\'re really\r\nliving now.\"</p>\r\n<p>Ah, yes. To be totally in the moment. But still,\r\nthe mud &ndash; sinking, fighting against it, sinking deeper. I tried anger\r\nas a motivator. Rage. Anything to tap reserves of strength. I saw Greg\r\nup ahead and hated him. I have walked since the beginning of my life\r\nand there he was, up ahead of me with a light tread. Fuck him.</p>\r\n<p>My\r\nthighs were shaking. My calves were aching. I was numb from my ankles\r\non down. My feet were lead. Could not stop. Could not stop.</p>\r\n<p>Fear\r\nset in. If that would not get me out of the mess, I figured nothing\r\nwould. I was embarrassed about how bad my condition was. Panic\r\nover-road pride. I must get out! Everything and everybody was holding\r\nme back. I should be able to fly...</p>\r\n<p>Boy was I becoming\r\ndelirious. Then came a jolt of pure exultation. My right foot found\r\nfirmer ground. Not much, but it was enough to stop and rest. The next\r\nstep I was sinking into the mud again. Hope was ripped away from me.\r\nThen I heard Greg-the-antichrist call out, \"It gets harder up here!\"</p>\r\n<p>I did not think that I could make it. Let me be honest. I was going to die out here.</p>\r\n<p>Cameron then exclaimed, \"Yeah, the ground\'s harder.\"</p>\r\n<p>Dan\r\nwas encouraging me to keep going. Greg and Cam had stopped to cheer me\r\non. My crushed pride was pushed aside by gratitude. My legs were\r\nrubbery. My lower back was strained. Then I felt firmer ground beneath\r\nmy feet. Just a little, but it was enough. Enough to catch my breath\r\nagain. Enough to pause just a moment. Energy quickly returned. I would\r\nwalk two or three steps and pause again. Take the weight off of one\r\nleg. I was able to look up and smile and give the thumbs up sign. Greg,\r\nCam, and Dan applauded. Knowing he was no longer needed, Greg hiked\r\nonward toward the lake. Slowly I caught up with Dan and Cam.</p>\r\n<p>\"Dude, I thought I was going to die.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"That was harsh, man.\"</p>\r\n<p>I\r\nwas ready to piss myself with fatigue, but as long as was out of the\r\nmud, I didn\'t care. The ground was no longer flat, but increasingly\r\nrough with small ruts and burms encrusted with a layer of salt. We had\r\nto watch where we were stepping. It was easy to twist something or take\r\na tumble. But it was exhilarating to be able to walk on top of the\r\nground, not in it.</p>\r\n<p>I had found my happy thought again.</p>\r\n<p>When\r\nwe hit Badwater Lake I no longer cared. Fatigue had sapped all of my\r\nanxieties about what lay ahead. Sure, the ground started to turn to mud\r\nagain. Didn\'t care. Sure, we were slipping. Didn\'t care. Sure, there\r\nwere waves on the glistening water. Didn\'t care. Sure, I would sink up\r\nto my ass in mud and water and salt... Oh well. Cameron had said it.\r\nLive in the moment. I was too tired not to. Besides, I was powerless to\r\nchange what was up ahead. And it was a freeing experience.</p>\r\n<p>The lake looked much too large to go around so Greg plunged ahead.</p>\r\n<p>Funny\r\nthing about fatigue and perspective. It looked like Greg was walking on\r\nthe water. The glare, the clouds, the atmosphere, mixed with the\r\nexhaustion and tunnel vision, Greg was trotting along the top of the\r\nwaves.</p>\r\n<p>Crazy.</p>\r\n<p>Then Dan hit the water way off to my\r\nright. He did not sink. \"It\'s not too bad!\" he called out. Cameron was\r\nat an equal distance off to my left, and, I\'ll be damned, he too was\r\nwalking on the waves.</p>\r\n<p>Just as I neared the lake the ground\r\nfirmed right up again. The salt had crystallized so thickly that I had\r\nsolid footing. Then I too, stepped into the water.</p>\r\n<p>I had to\r\nlaugh. It was only inches deep. It was so vast that the wind caused\r\nripples that looked like miniature waves. From a distance, without\r\nanything around it to give it perspective, they looked like ocean waves.</p>\r\n<p>The laughter came from down deep.</p>\r\n<p>The\r\neuphoria lasted for the rest of the hike. Sure, the water started\r\ngetting deeper. Big deal. There were a couple of dips that brought the\r\nwater up past my knees, but if I would have to swim, then I would swim.\r\nBut it never came to that. I remember looking out to my left and seeing\r\nCameron, a silhouette walking on top of what looked like a glistening\r\nsilver sea, and shouted, \"Cameron, You are the only pagan that I know\r\nthat can walk on water!\"</p>\r\n<p>Dan, to my right, was also a dark\r\noutline, save for his smiling teeth. Greg was a dot on the ocean up in\r\nfront. I saw him pause once, turn back to us, and stomp his feet, He\r\nwas on dry land again. The thought crossed my mind - what if there was\r\nmud on the other side? Would I be able to get through? I could only\r\nride the wave of emotions that carried me forward and not stop, just\r\nkeep going to the end.</p>\r\n<p>After all, it looked like it would only take, say, twenty minutes.</p>\r\n<p>I\r\noften wonder if our footprints are still there - immortalized for all\r\ntime, across one of the deepest parts of the world. Or, more probably,\r\nhas wind and water and time swept the valley clean again - forever\r\npristine, forever forbidding. I don\'t know. It doesn\'t matter, really.\r\nBut to me the thought will stand forever; a testimony to adventure, and\r\nto the bonds of friendship. They will be imprinted forever - like\r\nfootprints on the moon.</p>',4),(11,'2010-05-20 18:24:03','2011-04-15 20:38:11',1,6,'Charlie\'s Bus Hunt','Searching for Charlie Manson\'s bus near Barker Ranch.  \"Which way is west?\"','<p>We arrived at Barker Ranch and took it all in. I was surprised at\r\nhow it looked. It was a fairly decrepit structure, yet there were many\r\nnice parts too. There was spring-fed irrigation hosing keeping\r\nbeautiful irises alive.</p>\r\n<p>Part of our mission on the trip was to\r\nfind Charle\'s Manson\'s bus. Once we took a look at the building of the\r\nranch itself, most of us fanned out to search for the bus. I headed out\r\nshirtless, with only my Death Valley cap and an FRS radio. I walked up\r\nthe hill with Greg, Dan, Edric and the rest. Eventually, we fanned out\r\nenough that we were mostly out of eye-shot. We communicated over radio\r\nregarding our progress. I wanted to find it bad. I hiked as fast as I\r\ncould. I saw something that looked like white-painted metal down in a\r\nsmall canyon. I rushed down to look at it. It was only a flat white\r\nrock. I repeated this a few times as I got further and further from\r\nBarker Ranch.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually, we decided to call off the search\r\nfor the day. So we all started to head back. I came down the ridge I\'d\r\nclimbed. However, the fingers of the ridges and canyons were\r\nintertwined. I found I\'d come down a different ridge than I\'d gone up.\r\nAs I hiked down, I came to a road. I quickly realized I\'d gone the\r\nwrong way. I began to hike a tangental route back to where I thought\r\nthe ranch was. As I hiked, I heard a scratch on the radio. I hiked to a\r\ntall spot and made contact. Here is where we had our oft quoted\r\nconversation.</p>\r\n<p>\"Which way is west?\"</p>',5),(12,'2010-05-27 17:47:23','2011-04-15 20:37:59',1,9,'Last Chance Range','15 miles and 15 hours.

That\'s for sure.&nbsp; But, hey, isn\'t that always the case?<br /><br />This is probably still the hardest hike we\'ve ever done.&nbsp; The Cottonwood hike was super hard.&nbsp; But this was harder.<br /><br />Kyle and I had rolled in much later than everyone else to the camp near Ubehebe Mine.&nbsp; 3am was when we finally got in and got the tent setup so we could bed down.&nbsp; My Jeep had a new lift kit that has remained quite \"bouncy\" to this day.&nbsp; The washboards on the way to the mine were enough to shake out one\'s fillings.&nbsp; I was ready for sleep when we rolled in.<br /><br />We awoke the next morning to a beautiful day.&nbsp; The sun was shining, weather just perfect.&nbsp; Not too cold, not too hot.&nbsp; We had breakfast and were getting ready.&nbsp; Edric had planned to hike originally, but had...indulged... too much the night before.&nbsp; Kyle really wanted to hike himself, so Edric yielded to him and chose to drive my Jeep to the rendezvous point instead.<br /><br />The morning sailed past us, and we didn\'t get on the trail till after 11:00 am.&nbsp; I remember as we set off that Joaquin, my dog, was a little hesitant.&nbsp; He didn\'t seem like he really wanted to go.&nbsp; But I wanted him to.&nbsp; I wanted to get to hike and bond with him.&nbsp; I considered asking Edric to take him in the Jeep with him, wavered a bit, then decided to take Joaquin with us.&nbsp; Wrong choice, ended up.<br /><br />This was a hike through the Last Chance Mountain Range from Ubehebe Mine to Saline Valley.&nbsp; There was no real trail.&nbsp; Washes were the closest thing, and they worked quite well.&nbsp; We had studied the topo maps, and it looked very do-able.&nbsp; The descent at the end looked steep, but we\'d handled that before and always found a route ok.&nbsp; In reality, that was part of the attraction.&nbsp; <img src=\"/system/images/21/large_thumb/lastchance_1_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"286\" height=\"215\" style=\"margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;\" /><br />this was not the beaten path.&nbsp; This was the road less-travelled, and that\'s a lot of what we liked about it.&nbsp; Recounting our hike later to an old-timer we met at the hot-springs named \"Death Valley Dave,\" we had some degree of pride when we told him we\'d hiked through the Last Chance range and he responded with, \"Wow, I haven\'t done that one yet.\"&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />But we\'d find later why having a trail can be really nice.<br /><br />We hiked through the day: Dan, Kyle, Stuart, Joaquin and me.&nbsp; It was a great hike.&nbsp; Down washes, over sloping hillsides.&nbsp; We compared GPS features.&nbsp; Mine a wrist-top Garmin ForeTrex.&nbsp; Dan\'s an ancient Trimble Scout (one of the first consumer GPS units ever produced).&nbsp; We saw an interesting field where it looked like volcanic eruptions had landed magma bombs here.&nbsp; One curiously looked like a hand.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/26/large_thumb/lastchance_3_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"290\" height=\"217\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />We climbed up the hill to the ridge.&nbsp; At the ridge line, the views were spectacular, but the going was slower.&nbsp; Having no trail, it was unclear the simplest path.&nbsp; It had quite a bit of scrambling.&nbsp; Scrambling is fine for me, but Joaquin didn\'t care for it.&nbsp; I had to coax him across quite a bit of it.&nbsp; Helping him see the path where he could walk.&nbsp; It was slowing me down quite a bit.&nbsp; Everyone was substantially ahead of me.&nbsp; It was clear that he was tiring of the journey, and we weren\'t half way there yet.<br /><br />Did I mention that we weren\'t sure the road to Saline Valley would be open?&nbsp; We\'d heard reports that the road was dicey, so we weren\'t sure Mark, Edric and Chris could make it there.&nbsp; We were hiking this distance hoping we\'d have someone on the other side to meet us.&nbsp; When we got to the ridge, we attempted to raise mark on our handheld ham radios.&nbsp; No luck at first.<br /><br />The sun was beginning its descent as we approached the summit.&nbsp; I remember watching the glowing orb wondering if I could reach the summit before it set.&nbsp; When I was younger, I <img src=\"/system/images/23/large_thumb/lastchance_5_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"292\" height=\"216\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />recall seeing a movie called, \"Against a Crooked Sky,\" where a man\'s sister was captured by Native Americans and he had to cross an area on foot and reach a certain summit before the sun set to save her life.<br /><br />I was tired and Joaquin was tired and the sun was setting.&nbsp; My eye was on the setting sun as I pushed harder and harder to reach the summit.&nbsp; I realized that walking wasn\'t going to get me there.&nbsp; So I ran the last 100 feet or so just as the last glow of direct sunlight left the summit.&nbsp; I did it.&nbsp; I reached the summit before the sun set.&nbsp; I was more successful than the character in the movie.</p>\r\n<p><br />In the dusk that remained, we all took a break.&nbsp; Drank some water, ate a little, took some glory pictures.&nbsp; We finally reached Mark on the HT\'s.&nbsp; Ahh, what a relief.&nbsp; All down-hill from here.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/27/large_thumb/lastchance4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"285\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />How true that was.<br /><br />Did I mention there was no trail?&nbsp; Did I mention that the sun had just set.&nbsp; This meant we would be descending in the dark.&nbsp; OK, we\'d done that before.&nbsp; When we hiked into Butte Valley, we did that, and we got down ok.<br /><br />As it ends up, this was quite a bit steeper.&nbsp; Quite a bit.&nbsp; Our journey, as it was, had just begun...<br /><br />Dan was, of course, chief navigator with Stuart helping.&nbsp; He had a knack for it.&nbsp; But without light to compare features to the topo map, it was hard to navigate.&nbsp; None of us had a GPS with actual mapping in it.&nbsp; That might have helped.&nbsp; As it was, we did our best.&nbsp; Luckily, I had brought along a small LED diving flashlight which was very very bright.&nbsp; Dan was able to use it to scout the terrain features and attempt navigation.&nbsp; It was a bit hit or miss.&nbsp; Many times, he thought he\'d found a path down, only to find that when we followed it, it sloped down to near vertical.&nbsp; So we\'d hike back up to look some more.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/25/large_thumb/lastchance_6_.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right;

This was actually fine for us humans.&nbsp; But Joaquin didn\'t like it at all. (you can see his eyes reflecting in the flash of my camera)&nbsp; I swear he looked at me and said, \"You\'ve got to be kidding me.&nbsp; We\'re going down this?\"&nbsp; To which I replied, \"Sorry buddy, this is the best we got.&nbsp; We\'ll get down together, ok?\"<br /><br />This began my several hour experience of, \"C\'mon Joaquin!&nbsp; Good boy!&nbsp; You can do it.&nbsp; Come on, Buddy!&nbsp; That\'s right.&nbsp; Good boy!&nbsp; You can do it!\"&nbsp; This series of phrases was what I reiterated in a constant stream for hours.&nbsp; No exaggeration.&nbsp; It doesn\'t seem like a big deal, but you\'d be surprised.&nbsp; Try it out.&nbsp; I\'m not saying it was harder on me than Joaquin.&nbsp; He was really scared and did his best.&nbsp; It was hard for both of us.<br /><br />After the rocks, we had to slide down a seriously steep dirt slope.&nbsp; Joaquin had had enough.&nbsp; All the coaxing in the world could not get him to descend down that slope.&nbsp; So I did the only thing I could.&nbsp; I picked him up and cradled him in my arms and slid down the slope on my butt.&nbsp; Joaquin is an 85 pound dog.&nbsp; Not small.&nbsp; And when he felt me sliding down the slope, he freaked.&nbsp; He began to wiggle violently to get out of my grip.&nbsp; I managed to hold on to him till we got to the bottom, but neither of us enjoyed it, I can tell you.<br /><br />Thankfully, however, this was the end of the major descent.&nbsp; We were down.&nbsp; Now all that was left was to cross what the GPS told us was a long flat stroll to the rendezvous point along Saline Valley Road.&nbsp; This was sort of true.&nbsp; In reality there were little bumps we had to cross, washes 6-feet deep, etc.&nbsp; Not a huge deal.&nbsp; But after hiking what we just did, for 14 hours, another hour of hiking that was enough to make you into a zombie.<br /><br />Mark, our hero, was patiently waiting at the rendezvous point along the road.&nbsp; We now had easy radio contact with him over our handheld radios.&nbsp; But it was really easy to lose bearing in the dark, so we would periodically ask him to flash his headlights to make sure we were headed straight to him.&nbsp; None of us wanted to extend the hike due to getting off-track.<br /><br />That flat walk along the washes took at least an hour of zombie walking.&nbsp; When we reached Mark in Dan\'s truck, we were all so bloody relieved!&nbsp; I remember laughing because Joaquin, who is usually a bit reluctant to get into the Jeep, jumped in the back of the truck and bedded down instantly.&nbsp; We piled in, Dan in the front seat, the rest of us in the truck-bed, and we sailed to camp.<br /><br />It was 3am, but we still made our steak dinner and downed it greedily.&nbsp; I had promised Joaquin half my steak, and I kept my promise.&nbsp; He\'d earned steak.&nbsp; We all had.</p>',10),(13,'2010-06-29 23:38:35','2011-04-15 20:37:49',2,3,'Cottonwood','â€œI\'m just going to wing him.â€','<p>I figured he couldn\'t have been more than a quarter mile distant, which still made it a long shot for a hand gun.<img src=\"/system/images/28/large_thumb/cottonwood2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"231\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;...Er...what are you doing?&rdquo;&nbsp; Cameron asked as I withdrew my 9mm from it\'s holster.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I\'m just going to wing him.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, pulling back the slide. &ldquo;Maybe one to the leg.

Greg, a skinny chain smoker who practically never ate and never exercised, could always out-hike us; and he seemed to do it without exerting any effort whatsoever.&nbsp; Well, I\'d had enough.&nbsp; And despite the fact that a small part of me&nbsp; felt justified in doing it simply on principle alone, I wasn\'t really going to shoot him. Not today anyway.&nbsp; Instead I just squeezed off about five rounds into the nearest hillside.&nbsp; The gun shots echoed out across the large flat west of Cottonwood Canyon</p>\r\n<p>Up ahead, Greg stopped hiking.&nbsp; He turned to Edric who, along with Jack Dog, had been keeping pace with him.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I guess they want us to stop,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/36/large_thumb/jack_227.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />They sat down in the wash.&nbsp; Greg lit up a cigarette and then said, &ldquo;Hey! What the..?&rdquo; as dirt began to cascade over him.&nbsp; In an effort to find a cool place to lay, Jack Dog had begun digging, and Greg happened to be sitting directly in the path of the flying dirt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jack! C\'mon. Do you have to aim that right at me?&rdquo; Satisfied with his shallow hole, Jack spun around a few times and then flopped down in the cool earth. His panting grin seemed to say, &ldquo;Yes Greg, I do in fact have to aim that at you.&nbsp; And let\'s face it: you deserve it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>I love my dog.</p>\r\n<p>This was Jack Dog\'s first through-hike, and the first time he established himself as a premier trail finder.&nbsp; As we moved north out of the sandy flat and into the brush and boulder choked canyons, finding an easy path became his primary job.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/34/large_thumb/wild_burro.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />There were no real trails here. We\'d left those miles behind us. All we had were the barely discernible paths the wildlife used.&nbsp; &ldquo;Find the trail Jack!&nbsp; Good Boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He\'d sniff for a moment and then without hesitation take the only possible route through the tangle.</p>\r\n<p>As for the wildlife, we passed the remains of one of them, a bighorn sheep, near the top of dry gorge we were descending. Only his skull and spine were left.&nbsp; Earlier in the day as we crossed the flat, a braying wild burro had scolded us from a hill as ravens called from the air.&nbsp; Much higher, fighter jets from China Lake had banked and twinkled as they caught the midday sun, just tiny glints, thousands of feet above the Earth.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/35/large_thumb/Raven.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />But now the shadows were growing long in the canyon we were descending. Following the&nbsp; gorge&nbsp; roughly northeast, we had one ridge&nbsp; to cross before we could turn west and begin winding up the valley that would bring us to Goldbelt where Mark and Skip had made camp and had beers on ice; theoretically anyway.&nbsp; We still hadn\'t been able to make radio contact.</p>\r\n<p>When we reached an elevation equal to that of the saddle where we planned to cross the ridge, we left the gorge and began skirting the mountain to our left.&nbsp; The gorge continued down to our right, but we edged along the same elevation for nearly a mile as though we were following the topo line on a map. This way we hit the saddle without ever having to descend and then re-ascend unnecessarily.</p>\r\n<p>It was at the saddle we finally made contact with Mark.</p>',6),(14,'2010-07-05 22:23:44','2011-04-15 20:37:41',5,1,'Keane Wonder Mine Descent','I held my breath...  The lighter went â€˜snickâ€™','<p>Let us be honest for a moment, shall we?<br />This isn&rsquo;t something that anyone likes to say out loud, or even admit to oneself. But it is true.<br />People do not progress at the same speed and with the same agenda.<br />Nothing too revealing there.<br />However, while camping, it helps to progress as a group. Attitude is everything. It is a primary motivating factor that can make a good day great, or reverse it into despair. Melodramatic, I grant you. But true. Honest.<br />And after a week camping in an inhospitable desert, four 30 year old men start to go in different directions. It just happens.<br /><br />So while the hike down the Keane Wonder Mine Trail wasn&rsquo;t necessarily eventful, it was an important lesson to me to keep myself aware of when I start having a different agenda as the rest of the group. And in this case, the group consisted of only Greg and myself.<br /><br />After spending the morning rappelling (some more successfully than others) down the dry Monarch Falls cliff face, it was decided that <img src=\"/system/images/29/large_thumb/keane_descent_4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"226\" height=\"370\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Greg and I would reverse the hike that Dan and Cameron did the previous night. After all, they didn&rsquo;t die. They didn&rsquo;t get lost. Well, not permanently. There did not seem to be any long lasting damage done to them. And maybe this way we could get a different perspective of what they did. Different, as in doing it in sunlight, and no rain, and maybe some food, properly dressed, and with lots of time to spare. And downhill. We were really curious about how clearly marked the trail was. Also Dan really wanted us to report on the caves along the trail. I say caves, because a few of the larger entrances really didn&rsquo;t look like the typical mine tunnels. <br />I was eager to erase the memory of my repelling embarrassment and thought that a long downhill walk sounded like just the trick.<br /><br />We all drove back to the grave sight and mineshaft that I spent a substantial part of the previous cold night in, hanging on to Reepacheep, who had barked and freaked and had tried to bolt at every sound. From there Greg and I hopped out, and as Dan and Cam drove off we crested up the curving, treeless ridgeline along a fairly well marked trail. The vista overlooking Death Valley was remarkable. The trail looped back downward across smooth, sandy rock into the Keane Canyon.<br /><br />At that time I was pretty fatigued. The night had been long and stressful. There was not much I was able to do to help out in the hunt for Dan and Cam the night before. I was a failure at repelling. In other words, I was feeling pretty down on myself. I was looking forward to a leisurely walk. No pressure. Since the next morning we had planned to hike across the valley floor, I didn&rsquo;t want to do anything that would hinder my ability to complete the hike. I was not thinking about silver prospector Jack Keane, or his partner, the one-eyed Basque butcher named Domingo Etcharren who founded the mine in 1903. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about how this mine became the second biggest gold producer in Death Valley. Nor was I thinking about how to make this hike more adventurous, or dangerous, than it already was. I was simply lost in the moment of walking, not wanting any unnecessary risks.<br /><br />Greg, on the other hand, was pretty charged. He had missed out on the last nights exciting adventure, and the prospect of losing two friends had him wanting to spring into action. He was disappointed that we were reviewing a trail that had already been hiked. The danger was gone. The Monarch Falls repel had him antsy for more. And it showed. <br /><br />This observation is not a judgment. I don&rsquo;t think anyone was right or wrong. It was just our state of minds, which were going in different speeds and in different directions. We could manage being together, having had a lot of experience. It usually ended with Greg sighing deeply with restrained patience, and myself coming off as safety-oriented, if not a little whiney. Not exactly optimum, granted.&nbsp; And I was hoping that this week long trip would help to rectify that. But unfortunately, some habits are hard to break.<br /><img src=\"/system/images/31/large_thumb/keane_descent_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><br />The trail downward, as it curved over the rocks, was indeed difficult to follow. We had an advantage of being able to look down ahead and almost intuitively be able to navigate. But even then I remember having to slow down and really become aware, eyes peeled for any rock cairns, or any sign of direction. There was one particular section in which Dan had warned us about, where we lost the trail altogether. Greg found it again. We kept commenting how much it would suck if you couldn&rsquo;t see due to cloud banks and rain and night and cold and &hellip; But the trail became clearer again as it hugged alongside the cliff face. The only real difficulty was the constant downwards impact on our knees. Greg kept up a ritualistic chant: Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/37/large_thumb/wonderminetram_232.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"158\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />Eventually we came upon the mining complex clinging to the canyon face. There was quite a lot there, far more than I anticipated. The showstopper was the ore tram towers, and the cables still tantalizingly intact, that ran down the canyon to the valley far below. An ore cart hung suspended. It reminded me of a ski lift. The huge gear wheels were still there. The remains of the giant mill. An old water tank. Cool stuff. Alongside a road-like embankment were several mine openings. They were large, cavern sized, with several typical, straight, narrow bore shafts branching out into the mountainside. The ceiling had collapsed in places, but it was roomy and dry. This obviously was where Cam and Dan had contemplated staying the night. Greg and I even thought it would be a cool campsite for a future trip. It was hard to find a smooth spot to bed down on with all the rock and debris, but with enough poking around I was sure one could find comfort.<br /><br />Relaxing in the cool dryness got me light headed. I thought of napping. I thought of a cold beer. I felt very separated from the rest of the world. Greg, by contrast, wanted to poke his head down some mine shafts. Climb into something. On something. I mean, when would we be here again? Life is short, right? That was what we came here for in the first place. But all the shuffling, and the rock shifting, and then the falling debris and dust started to intrude into my solemnity.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh &hellip; my &hellip;&rdquo; I heard Greg gasp. I didn&rsquo;t stir. I was use to this. But, of course, every nerve lit up and the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, and that cold clammy pit in my stomach yawned opened. I am so easy to goad. But still, I tried to look cool and relaxed.<br /><br />&ldquo;Words, Greg. I need words.&rdquo; Familiar dialogue between us.<br /><br />&ldquo;This is &hellip; bad.&rdquo; Greg&rsquo;s words were broken. Then that damned silence. Too much damned silence. Was he trying to be dramatic? Was he pushing my buttons again? Did something incredible just blow his mind? Or could there be, as much as I didn&rsquo;t want to there to be, a problem?<br /><br />&ldquo;Do I need to run?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oooohhhhh. Maybe.&rdquo; Silence again. Rustling. &ldquo;You need to see this.&rdquo;<br /><br />Did I really? Did I really need to see? Yeah, I know I did. That was, as I said, why we came. I slowly unkinked myself and gingerly headed to a far corner of the cavern where I spied Greg. He was standing ramrod straight and looking down near his feet at some rubble, When I approached he turned slowly to me, eyes wide, mouth open. Then he pointed like the Spirit of Christmas Future at what he had found. There amongst the fallen rocks were several old wooden cases, their slats loose, some broken. They looked like old style footlockers. Immediately I thought they were caskets. But I shook the thought away. No, it was worse. Stenciled on them was the word &lsquo;Dynamite&rsquo;<br /><br />Oh shit<br /><br />Now, you have to remember that at that time Greg and I were obsessing on the 1977 film Sorcerer. The premise was the obstacle of transporting old, sweating, unstable dynamite across 212 mile of stinking Central American jungle. The very last thing that I wanted to see while inside an old, crumbling, unstable, 85 year old blast hole was a crushed case of dynamite. Was there any still in there? Was it sweating out beads of pure nitroglycerin as we stood slack jawed over it? Was it just waiting for the right jolt to &hellip; go off? Would a loose rock shift and ignite it? Would the presents of flame cause our immediate death? I had visions of Dan and Cameron seeing a plume of dust and smoke up along the Funeral Mountains, knowing that it was the end of us. My body was already headed for the cavern opening. Then I stopped. I had to know. But Greg was already pulling aside the wooden slats.&nbsp; &ldquo;GREG!&rdquo; I hissed. He just brought up a hand to silence me. Really. Did I want to startle him at the moment? However, I had a sneaking suspicion that he was poking around in the locker just to get a rise out of me. My hypersensitive nature was showing again, and I became embarrassed. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Greg was silent. After another moment I asked again, &rdquo;Greg?&rdquo; <br /><br />He let out a long strained breath and sat down next to the cases. He just looked at me. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette. Now, I knew right there and then that there was no danger. But that damned look in his eyes, and the knowledge that I could be so baited, and that I had once again showed my anxiety, got the better of me. Reflexive fear took hold. I just shook my head &lsquo;no&rsquo; as Greg&rsquo;s lighter came out. <br /><br />This fucker has a death wish, I thought for the umpteenth time. But does he need to take me out as well? <br /><br />Greg grinned.<br /><br />I held my breath.<br /><br />The lighter went &lsquo;snick&rsquo;<br /><br />Nothing happened, of course, except that the cigarette was now lit and Greg relaxed, fully enjoying the moment. What was the problem?<br /><br />The problem was that the moment was at my expense. I should have laughed. Because my reaction was damned funny. I still think that it is funny even now. Oh, but how I resented being so easily manipulated. I kept thinking, I don&rsquo;t mind some recklessness if there is some gain, some end that justify the action. But recklessness just to get a rise out of me, or because of boredom isn&rsquo;t worth the price.<br /><br />Obviously, I think in my head too much.<br /><br />I knew that my uptight mood showed on my face. And it prompts people to target me to get me to relax and enjoy life a little more. Let&rsquo;s face it; I need it. But the thought kept running through my head: What if something did happen? Could I get Greg out of here? Could I get him off of the mountain and to safety? Therein laid the root of my anxiety. I felt that I could not take care of the situation by myself. And that thought burned me. I trusted the other three, but I, myself, was untrustworthy. <br /><br />Fuck.<br /><br />I hate being a spectator in life when people all around me are truly living it.<br /><br />So, later, when we came across an old cable still set into its pulley system that levelly traversed a small ravine alongside the trail, my heart sank. But I tried to rally, and as Greg and I exchanged looks, we both nodded in agreement. It looked do-able. Greg ran right up to it, and I followed cautiously. We tested out weight on it, individually, then together. The total length was about fifty feet. Make that sixty. It looked like one could stand on the bottom cable and keep a hold of the top cable with ones hands at about shoulder height. Then, with luck, and if the pulleys didn&rsquo;t move too much, and if the cables were strong enough still to support one or both of us, and if the ancient supports could still support the flywheels, then we could walk across like a one-strand rope bridge. The bottom of the ravine, some 20 feet below, was littered with rocks and bits of old rusted metal. But there was nothing on the other side of the pulley system, just more bare, sloping canyon. So as Greg hopped on and started inching his way toward the far side, my motivation lagged. If there were something on that damned other side that was worthwhile, then it would be an awesome traverse. But since there was nothing there, it seemed pointless. Oh, the crossing would be fun, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to outweigh the possible danger. If someone slipped, getting him out of the ravine would be a chore. And there was all that rusted metal too. In addition, once across, you would have to repeat the traverse back again. Once again, I felt that I was not able to physically keep Greg from harm if he injured himself. Or myself, for that matter. So I stopped. My excuse was that I didn&rsquo;t think the cables could hold both of us. Besides, they kept shifting. Then, with even Greg&rsquo;s infinitesimal weight, the bottom cable kept sagging until Greg could barely keep hold of the top cable with his hands outstretched above him. Just before the point of no return, he stopped. The breeze whistled in the stillness. He bounced on the bottom cable, checking its give. Then he decided the stretch was too much. He was so close, but he shook his head. It was tempting to push through it, but the logistics of keeping hold of either the top or the bottom cable appeared to be too much. All he said was, &ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; and started to slow trek back.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/32/large_thumb/keane_descent_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"221\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />After his feet were on the solid trail again, it took Greg a long while of looking at those cables before he could pull himself away and head back down to the canyon floor. There was a missed opportunity to make the hike memorable. Unfortunately, deep inside I was relieved. And since we are being honest, I have to say that for the rest of the descent, I felt like a pussy. The walk was in silence. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee. Bang-on-the-knee &hellip;<br /><br />It is important to remember and acknowledge that a good long trip is not filled with one hundred percent happy experiences. There will be low times, boring times, uncomfortable times, annoying times, etcetera. That is part of the price of admission. How well you deal with it is the determining factor of the trip. It is all about attitude.<br /><br />The evening was getting long and our knees were getting sore. There was still much to be done. We had to find a place to camp for the night (which turned into a wonderful treasure hunt supplied by the guys) and tomorrow would be the hike across Badwater. There was still time to adjust the attitude. Which was a good thing, because I was going to need it.<br /><br /><br /><br />NOTE:<br />This is a Public Service Message I found on the web<br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: courier;\">Park Service has decided to bar public access to the Keane Wonder Mine. It&rsquo;s just too dangerous for people to mess around there. The remains, which include unstable wooden structures and rusting equipment and debris, are in an advanced state of decay and collapse. The area near the ore-processing mill has tailings and other materials contaminated with heavy metals and toxic chemical residues. Among the more lethal hazards are crumbling tunnels, exposed or minimally protected vertical shafts, and rock masses susceptible to falling or sliding.<br /><br />These are more than just hypothetical threats. A visitor was killed at the Keane Wonder Mine in 1984 when he fell down an unprotected vertical shaft. That risk still exists at the site, too.

The sandy washes and gentle slopes we walked were a joy. Nothing to indicate what was to come.<br /><br />Joaquin had proven himself a tough hiking dog on a previous big through-hike, South Park Canyon, which would also end up being Jack Dog\'s last.&nbsp; Jack had done well, but it was clear that time was catching up with my old pooch.&nbsp; As such I retired him from hiking, and on this day he rode in my truck with Chris at the wheel.&nbsp; Edric drove Cam\'s Jeep, and our ever reliable base camp manager Mark Mooney drove Greg\'s Jeep, leading the group on a long circuitous route that would take them back through Stovepipe and ultimately into Saline Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=\"/system/images/51/large_thumb/003.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;\" />(Greg, sadly, hadn\'t made the trip at all.&nbsp; He was home in bed, with a terrible flu.&nbsp; The bitter irony being that it would have been the first Death Valley Trip with his new Jeep. Instead, his Jeep just came without him.

Instead, we found the southern part of&nbsp; the ridge topped with 10 to 20 foot tall spikes of decomposing granite, like some giant stone mo-hawk.&nbsp; Crap.&nbsp; Now began a slow, torturous skirting of said mo-hawk over broken boulders along the steep westerly slope of the ridge.<br /><img src=\"/system/images/56/large_thumb/tireddog.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"247\" style=\"float: right; margin: 5px;\" /><br />It was here Cam began his famous mantra, &ldquo;C\'mon Joaquin!

In the failing light it grew cold.&nbsp; Posing next to an odd semi-triangle-shaped metal contraption (we assumed an old survey device of some sort) we took a few pictures, began layering on clothes and tried to contact Mark via the radio.<br /><br />We had been attempting to reach him intermittently throughout the day with no success.&nbsp; But on the peak, with the disappearing orb of the sun about to dive behind the Inyo Mountains to our west, we had straight line-of-sight into Saline Valley. &nbsp;<br /><br />I thumbed the radio key. &ldquo;N6YQR, KI6TCR.&nbsp; Mark --- do you copy?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; He answered immediately.<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/52/large_thumb/sunset.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; float: right;\" />Mark and the convoy were almost directly due West of us, making the last few miles on Saline Valley road before they\'d turn north east towards the hot springs.&nbsp; As we chatted back and forth I noted an odd rattling sound in the background whenever Mark was speaking.&nbsp; I assumed it was some loose piece of gear and didn\'t think about it again ---- not until we were back home and discovered all the bushings in the Jeep\'s aftermarket shock and lift kit had been obliterated.&nbsp; Death Valley 1, Greg\'s new Jeep 0.<br /><em><br />Moon</em><br /><br />With darkness approaching I felt a nagging sense of urgency.&nbsp; The first mile or so north of the peak was still quite flat, and we made good time.&nbsp; It wasn\'t until we reached the final set of boulder strewn valleys we needed to navigate on the way to the ridge I\'d tagged for our descent down to the alluvial fan, that I began to worry about the consequences of a sacred rule we had broken for this hike. &nbsp;<br /><br />We always, ALWAYS coordinated our trips with full moon.&nbsp; It made it a bit tougher on everyone\'s schedules but it was always worth it --- especially when hiking off-trail after nightfall.&nbsp; And now we were doing just that, but with only a sliver of crescent that wouldn\'t rise for hours.&nbsp; Headlamps were great for what was directly beneath your feet.&nbsp; But with no moonlight to give the big picture...<br /><br />Darkness was now complete.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on where we were and where we needed to go, I\'d laid out a route that skirted several ridges and led us directly to our descent point with minimal up and down.&nbsp; At least, that\'s what the topo lines showed.&nbsp; But as we know, a lot can happen between two topo lines.&nbsp; With no moon it was impossible to look ahead at the terrain and make necessary adjustments while hiking.&nbsp; Perched the edge of a small valley, I pulled-out the map, my compass, and my GPS, an old-school Trimble Scout Master that only read coordinates.&nbsp; I figured it wouldn\'t be too hard to just follow the compass, pausing occasionally to take a reading with the GPS and then adjust accordingly<br /><br />It quickly proved to be a nightmare.<br /><br />We scrambled along the hillside by headlamp, over boulders and decomposing granite piles and through bushes; the terrain was torturous. And it was only getting worse.<br /><br />&ldquo;C\'mon Joaquin! You can do it!&nbsp; Good boy!&rdquo;<br /><br />Time and time again I\'d stop and try to locate our position on the map.&nbsp; And time and time again we weren\'t where I thought we were.&nbsp; We were moving horribly slowly. <br /><br />&ldquo;C\'mon Joaquin! You can do it!&nbsp; Good boy!&rdquo;<br /><br />We\'d been on the trail nearly twelve hours at this point.&nbsp; Exhaustion and frustration was beginning to set in.&nbsp; Even Kyle, the Zen Force himself was muttering something about &ldquo;Getting off this fucking mountain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stuart was silent.&nbsp; I was getting pissed.<br /><br />&ldquo;C\'mon Joaquin! You can do it!&nbsp; Good boy!&rdquo;<br /><br />I sat down for what seemed like the twentieth time and tried to plot our position amongst the boulders. <br /><br />&ldquo;Fuck! What the hell?&rdquo;<br /><br />I\'m usually not the one who loses my shit when things get difficult --- but I was close to losing it now.&nbsp; Conversely, the endlessly self-effacing Stuart who always claimed to be on the edge of some mental, emotional or physical breakdown suddenly stepped-up like a drill sergeant and snapped me back into line:&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is the ridge?&rdquo;&nbsp; he barked.<br /><br />I blinked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It\'s, uh, that way.&nbsp; Back that way.&rdquo;&nbsp; I pointed vaguely east.<br /><br />&ldquo;We make for the ridge,&rdquo;&nbsp; he said, &ldquo;get the fuck out of this shit and just go the long way around.&rdquo; Then he turned and scrambled off that direction. <br /><br />He was right.&nbsp; I\'d opted for what looked like a more direct route to our descent point. On the map it made sense, but with moonlight we would have seen rough terrain, the folly of going that way. In the dark, we had no chance. <br /><br />The full-moon is your friend. <br /><br />We climbed back to the ridge and plodded on through the night. An hour or so later, we reached the edge of the world.<br /><br /><em>One exhausted dog</em><br /><br />As always, the place I\'d chosen for our descent was based on the letter &ldquo;U&rdquo;.&nbsp; On a topo map, a series of U shapes pointing downhill indicated a spur, or a &ldquo;finger&rdquo; as we called it.&nbsp; Sometimes these were very narrow with steep cliffs on either side.&nbsp; (Once, while searching for a spur I\'d found on the map to descend from the north side of Wild Rose peak, we got lost in a small forest of juniper trees and couldn\'t see very far ahead.&nbsp; The ground became steeper and steeper, until finally we had to rely on the GPS to guide us to where our &ldquo;finger&rdquo; began and we could make our way down into Trail Canyon.&nbsp; Looking back up at Wild Rose as we descended, all we saw were vertical walls to either side of our 10-foot-wide fin of rock.&nbsp;&nbsp; There hadn\'t been much room for error.)&nbsp; But as sketchy as following the U\'s could be, it was still much more desirable than trying to descend the inverted V\'s.&nbsp; A series of&nbsp; V shapes pointing up-hill indicated a wash or gorge, often choked with brush and complete with dry-fall cliffs, too small to be seen on the map, but plenty big to ruin your day.<br /><br />So it was the U\'s I\'d sought, and we now stood above the best ones the north side of the Last Chance Range had to offer. &nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;We\'re going down <em>this</em>?&rdquo;&nbsp; I don\'t remember who said it.&nbsp; It might have been me.<br /><br />It felt like we were standing on the edge of some giant chasm.&nbsp; Our headlamps only penetrated 20 feet or so down the boulder strewn escarpment.&nbsp; Just beyond the reach of our lights could be anything: just more boulders, or a drop-off.&nbsp; We wouldn\'t know until we were on top of it. <br /><br />Somewhere out there in the dark, 2000 feet below us, was the alluvial fan: flat, beautiful, only a mile or so walk to the road where Mark would pick us up. But first, we had to negotiate this near-precipice. &nbsp;<br /><br />Slowly, carefully, we began making our way down. &nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;C\'mon Joaquin! You can do it!&nbsp; Good boy!&rdquo;<br /><br />That is when the dog sat down...and refused to move. &nbsp;<br /><br />Poof......Perfection achieved.<br /><br />Perched on the absurdly steep mountain side, Joaquin was finish. He just wasn\'t getting up.&nbsp; To protect his paws, I\'d given him Jack Dog\'s old booties.&nbsp; (These had always proved a blessing when we hiked off-trail, and I still felt guilty for the times we\'d hiked before he had them, and his paws got cut.)&nbsp; Now, on top of his absolute exhaustion, Joaquin had managed to loose one of the booties. He was the sweetest dog, always wanting to please. But he was done.<br /><br />&ldquo;C\'mon Joaquin! You can do it! C\'mon buddy! You can do it! Get up! You can do it!&rdquo; &nbsp;<br /><br />Nope. Too tired.&nbsp; Paws too sore. See? I lost a bootie.<br /><br />It took every ouch of patience Cam had to finally coax him into moving again. It almost felt like animal abuse.<br /><br />By now, Mark had made his way up the 4x4 road past the hot springs, and sat parked in my truck.&nbsp; We had direct line of sight, and thus perfect radio contact.&nbsp; Edric and Chris were back at camp, enjoying a soak and listening to our chatter on one of the other radios.&nbsp; Every little while I\'d have Mark flash the headlights just so we could see our finish line.&nbsp; As the hours dragged on, it didn\'t see to be getting any closer at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;C\'mon Joaquin! You can do it! Good boy!&rdquo;<br /><br /><img src=\"/system/images/54/large_thumb/dots_in_black.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right; margin: 5px;\" />It would have been a beautiful view with the full moon: a silvery desert-scape below stretching out to the dark horizon. Instead it was just each of us with our tiny pool of light, little dots on the black mountainside. Nothing but the sound of Cam\'s encouraging voice, and one set of endlessly distant running-lights marking the terminus of our journey.<br /><br />It was well after midnight.&nbsp; We were beyond tired, beyond hungry. <br /><br />All I could think of was the beer I knew awaited me at the truck.&nbsp; It didn\'t even sound good; it was just the principle.&nbsp; That beer was our victory dance.<br /><br />Eons passed. &nbsp;<br /><br />We reached the bottom. &nbsp;<br /><br />The last few miles across the flat of the alluvial fan were more stagger than walk.&nbsp; At least it was flat.<br /><br />At nearly 3am, we finally reached Mark and the truck.&nbsp; It was almost surreal. <br /><br />I didn\'t care how brutally bumpy it was on the short ride back to the hot springs, even if it did make my beer foamy. &nbsp;<br /><br />I only knew it felt good to sit. &nbsp;<br /><br />&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br /><br />Epilogue:&nbsp; The Curse of Greg\'s Ride<br /><img src=\"/system/images/61/large_thumb/jeepfix.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" style=\"margin: 5px; vertical-align: bottom;\" /><br />Since the first DVDogs trip, it had become tradition that whatever vehicle Greg drove to Death Valley had at least one major break-down per trip:&nbsp; Broken leaf-springs, utterly failed brakes, broken radiator, etc.<br /><br />This trip, Greg\'s Jeep had come without him, AND it was a fairly new ride in great shape. We figured this had to be the trip that would break the curse.<br /><br />Not so.<br /><br />Besides the failed shock bushings we didn\'t discover until we arrived home, somehow the steering alignment nut had come loose while Mark was driving the Saline Valley Road, and the adjustment sleeve was slowly unscrewing itself.&nbsp; He noticed the steering wheel wasn\'t lining up properly when he was going straight, and that it seemed to be getting progressively worse.&nbsp; By the time they reached the hot springs, he\'d lost the ability to turn left altogether.<br /><br />Death Valley 2, Greg\'s new Jeep 0<br /><br />This was easily adjusted the next day, so really no harm, no foul.&nbsp; However, somehow we also managed to loose about a third of Greg\'s expensive Ham Radio antenna.&nbsp; It just fell off.<br /><br />Death Valley 3, Greg\'s new Jeep 0.<br /><br />But in the end it all worked out for the best:&nbsp; Greg got a new antenna, a fresh set of bushings, and for being such a great guy and letting us use his new Jeep while he was laid-up sick, we bought him a 9000lb Warne Winch.<br /><br />Sometimes it pays to be a great guy.&nbsp; Even if you do have a curse.</p>',10),(16,'2011-01-27 04:49:01','2011-04-15 20:37:17',5,5,'Wildrose','The way down, while rocky, was open and easy going. So easy, in fact, and without any restraint of a trail, we started heading down very rapidly.','<p>WILDROSE PEAK HIKE<br />OCTOBER 1998<br /><br />Dan called me up and told me I was going back to Death Valley. No exceptions. I was going. Period.<br /><br />And thus my return to the valley that I had not seen since my thirtieth birthday. I had missed a few trips, and it was time to reenter the wilderness that had captured my heart. This time we had a clear-cut agenda: A through-hike. We would attempt to crest Wildrose Peak, and then &hellip; kind of find some way to hike down the east side of the Panamint mountain range and hopefully find our camp. Easy.<br /><br />Regrettably, Greg was not available. Dan and Cameron and I were joined this time by Johnny, his younger brother Billy, and the incomparable Captain Mark Mooney. The &lsquo;A&rsquo; Team would be Dan, Cam, Billy and myself as the hikers. Mark and Johnny were the &lsquo;B&rsquo; Team that would relocate the rigs and set up the new camp. Keys were exchanged, &lsquo;goodbye&rsquo;s and &lsquo;good luck&rsquo;s were said, and they drove the rigs from the trailhead near the Charcoal Kilns back down and around the mountain range to a designated place in Trail Canyon that washes down into Death Valley.<br /><br />Wildrose Peak is a rounded, dome-like mountaintop in the Panamint Range that summits at 9,064 feet. The trail is only a little over four miles long, and a two thousand foot ascension.&nbsp; But the trail stops there. As Dan said, that was were the fun would begin.<br /><br />The October weather was picture perfect, sunny and blue with a cool breeze that brought a hint of ice from the higher peaks. The trail started out steeper than I expected as we climbed out of Wildrose Canyon. I kept thinking the altitude was getting to me. But I had been harboring a secret. It was a little something that I was trying to keep from myself; I was having problems breathing. I didn&rsquo;t say the word because it scared me: Asthma.<br />At a prime age of thirty-three, this was embarrassing. I brushed it off as an allergic reaction and just work through it.<br /><br />Cameron and Billy were already way up ahead of me. Dan hung back to stay with my lumbering pace. I should have acted grateful, but instead something just slipped. With tongue firmly planted in my cheek, I decided to explain in a prophetic demeanor what would happen to him if he didn&rsquo;t fully commit to his personal relationship back home. It was that type of stream-of-consciousness sort-of-thing that always gets me into trouble. But I was on a roll. I pointed out the clear, step by step process of how his life would crumble one miniscule bit at a time, until he slipped into a depthless pit of misery and despair that had no hope of redemption. I thought it was well calculated out, believable, and pretty damned funny. Which means I was being an asshole. Poor Dan.<br /><br />The trail leveled off as it cleared the shade of the canyon and the pinyon pine and juniper trees. And there, across the top of the ridge was a view of Death Valley deep below in the vast white salt flats of Badwater. I tried fruitlessly to see if our footprints were still there from three yeas before. Here we headed north and up to another ridge crest that we followed to the rounded base of Wildrose.<br /><br />Then the snowballs fell upon us.<br /><br />Dan and I were cresting up the first of a series of twisting switchbacks that strafed across the side of the steep slope when the sky darkened and we were hit by the ice and snow. From above we could hear the laughter of Cameron and Billy. We didn&rsquo;t realize that we were just below the snowline. Obviously, they were above it. Ambushed. We didn&rsquo;t stand a chance.<br /><br />They let us catch up with them, Cameron holding his belly from laughing so hard. We retaliated. They took cover and let us have it. After regrouping we all studied the zig zaging lines on the USGS topo map and figured all we had to do was push on a little longer and we would be at the top. The snow was only on the shadowy south side of the slope and dusted lightly enough not to cause us any problems. The trail was rockier and bare of trees. My lungs were screaming in a red, swollen haze, but the trail leveled off once again and we were at the summit. It looked, however, like the others had not even broken a sweat.<br /><br />We took a break at the USGS marker and wrote in the peak&rsquo;s journal that was kept in an ammunition box. Then we pondered the map again trying to figure out what Dan had planned. It seemed easy enough. We just had to be aware that below our line of sight there were some drop-offs that appeared, in a word, steep. Lethal, would be another word. Probably more accurate too. There was a small ridgeline that was bordered by two such lethal cliffs that should take us down to a navagatable area on the east side of the range. As long as we found this ridge, we were okay. If we missed it &hellip; well, that was not going to happen.<br /><br />We took in the summit view one last time. South of us was Telescope Peak. East was the expanse of Death Valley and the looming Funeral Mountains. Mount Whitney was to the west of us, if you knew where to look. We left the trail&rsquo;s end point and headed east down off the mountain.<br /><br />The way down, while rocky, was open and easy going. So easy, in fact, and without any restraint of a trail, we started heading down very rapidly. We were off the dome in no time and into the tree line. I remember hearing Dan call out for us to head &lsquo;right&rsquo;, since we were spread out in no discernable pattern, all pelting down at high speed with no thought for anyone else. I was in the dirt now, surrounded by shady trees, and with no view at all. I slid to a stop in a shower of dust and rocks to catch my breath and to figure out how far &lsquo;right&rsquo; I was suppose to go. Then I looked down.<br /><br />One of those lethal cliffs lay at my feet. Right at my feet. It was unbelievable how I did not see it. A low line of bushes crowned the rim, right where I was standing.&nbsp; Literally, two more steps down and &hellip;<br /><br />I heard the scraping and sliding of Dan above me. I shouted out for him to stop. He came skidding up to me, half burying my feet in dirt. I reached out to steady him and stop his momentum. He was grinning from ear to ear. &ldquo;That was fun!&rdquo; he said, then he looked past me, then down; the smile slid off of his face. &ldquo;Holy &hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Uh huh,&rdquo; was all I was able to utter.<br />He leaned over farther for a better look. &ldquo;Dude!&rdquo; He turned back to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;We almost died!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Uh huh,&rdquo; was all I was able to utter.<br /><br />Dan started shouting for Billy and Cameron who were somewhere to the &lsquo;right&rsquo; of us. They came back over where we could regroup. Cameron said, &ldquo;It gets pretty steep over there,&rdquo; pointing back to the way they came.<br />&ldquo;Uh huh,&rdquo; was all I was able to utter.<br /><br />Dan whipped out his GPS unit to find the ridge that he had meant us to descend down.<br />&ldquo;Is that it right over there?&rdquo; I asked looking at the barest little thread of a ridge that merely peeped out from the cliff face right next to us.<br />&ldquo;Nah&rdquo; Dan dismissed it. He checked his GPS against the topo map. &ldquo;Wait, it should be right over there,&rdquo; he pointed to the same ridge. He looked up again. &ldquo;Huh. I guess that is it after all.&rdquo;<br /><br />It was not very big, but it would be enough for us to get down. And down we went, much more carefully and somberly for this leg of the journey. There were some sketchy spots, but armed with the knowledge that this is the only way to go, and with no turning back, we hiked down the exposed spine and eventually into a large ravine without incident. Here there was a spring and some shade and vegetation. A ramshackle miner&rsquo;s shed still stood. And a mineshaft. A perfect spot to rest and sooth our trembling legs.<br /><br />The mineshaft was beckoning, and I do not have a clear memory of either Dan or I going in. I think we did, but mostly I remember Cameron and Billy. Billy was hesitant, but Cameron was full of adventure. I clearly saw his light silhouette himself and Billy as they ventured into the darkness. It is funny how memory starts to distort with time. This incident (oh yes, there was an incident) melds with the events that took place in the hollow mountain of Skidoo. I remember getting a headache. It was sudden, like the thinnest ice pick to the right side of my temple. And I remember losing my breath. So I got out, fast. But that had happened at Skidoo as well. I remember staying outside the mine feeling the breeze, moist from the spring, upon my face. Then there was a commotion from inside the mine. I remember Dan and Billy pulling Cameron out. Their faces were set and serious. I remember thinking, &lsquo;This is not the time or place for an accident. We are still hundreds of feet up the side of a bare, God forsaken, desert mountain range.&rsquo;<br /><br />In the light outside, Cameron looked green. It was a shade of green that looked like an undercoating of a newly forming bruise. It was very faint, but defiantly green.<br />&ldquo;Dude! You&rsquo;re green!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.<br /><br />How does one care medically for someone who has gone green? Air? Check. Water? Check. Induce vomiting? Luckily, the deathly hue started clearing so it didn&rsquo;t look like it was needed. Was Cameron poisoned? Did he get a whiff of the legendary and lethal &lsquo;bad air&rsquo; that hangs low in unvented mineshafts? Were there going to be any long-term effects?<br /><br /><br />Poor Cameron was shaken and very nervous, but lucid and talking to us the whole time. There was confusion as to what had happened. Apparently Cameron had seen some interesting looking fungus that was growing on the side of the mineshaft. He had stopped to take off his glove and touch it, and his fingers went numb. Were the two events related? Then he felt lightheaded and was pulled out of the mine. Was that related? There were mixed feelings of excitement and disbelief. Perhaps his coloring was an optical illusion brought on by the refracted light through the shadows and vegetation? No, he was definitely green. He was breathing easily now that he had a fresh breeze, so CPR was not necessary (however much some of us wanted to use it as an excuse). Was he poisoned? If so, was it respiratory or topical? We told him to wash off his hand that did indeed look red and slightly swollen. He gulped in fresh air. He drank plenty of filtered water. He was patient as we all perched around him ready to spring into whatever action was needed. We waited as he slowly resumed a healthier looking demeanor. Obviously, when he felt able to, he wanted to get out of there. We didn&rsquo;t argue, but kept a watchful eye on him as we continued our way down to camp. Cameron looked more embarrassed than anything, but we wanted to make sure he was not going to suddenly drop dead, or become faint and fall off the damned mountainside.<br /><br />As it was, the farther away from that mine Cameron got, the better he looked. His strength returned, and for the remainder of the hike was without problems. And for the rest of us, the strange event at the mineshaft became more and more unreal. Except, probably, for Cameron.<br />He kept quiet the fact that his fingers had not felt normal for months afterwards. What had really happened? One can only speculate. But we all felt thankful that whatever did transpire did not escalate into something life threatening.<br />&nbsp;<br />I was ready to make an end of it. We had leveled off into Trail Canyon that fed off into the alluvial fan that slides it way down into the valley floor. Mission complete. We traversed the mountain range. On Dan&rsquo;s map there was a marked four-wheel drive road that we were to follow out to where our camp should be. The problem was that there were more than one road exiting the canyon through a network of burms and washes. After checking and rechecking the map we figured the best thing we could do was simply head downhill. But fatigue started to make us second-guess if we were going the right way. We were so close, but couldn&rsquo;t connect the last dot. Dan contacted Mark and Johnny over the radio, but they could not seem to pinpoint each other&rsquo;s location. They were driving; we were walking. But we were not finding each other.<br /><br />The starting and stopping was driving me crazy, so I started out on my own. I needed a beer and my tent.<br /><br />We all knew that we were close, so apparently Dan thought it was a good idea to fire off a round of his nine millimeter so Mark could take a sounding and home in on us. I &lsquo;guess&rsquo; this was a good idea, but considering how sound bounces off canyon walls, I suspect it was simply an excuse for Dan to squeeze off a few.<br /><br />I however, being somewhat ahead of the group, was not privy to this new development. I was focusing on what was ahead of me, keeping my ears open to the sound of the truck, when suddenly from behind I heard an unmistakable &lsquo;crack&rsquo;!<br /><br />My first thought was that Dan shot me.<br />Then, to duck and cover, but I was too tired for that.<br />Then, &lsquo;Did Dan just shoot AT me?&rsquo;<br />Then, &lsquo;Why the hell did Dan just shoot at me?? I&rsquo;m not Greg!&rsquo;<br /><br />I realized that I was standing dead still and that the rest of the hiking group was laughing. Part of me wanted to rush him, but he was armed, so that was stupid. But I knew it was on my face because Dan slowly put the gun away. But he looked like he was satisfied with his revenge after my stream-of-conscious rant about him earlier.<br /><br />Then the truck arrived.<br /><br />Well, maybe the gunshot really did work.<br /><br />That shadow that had fallen over us was dissipated back at camp. Mark and Johnny welcomed our return. There was beer and food and friends and lots of laughter. We were young and indestructible once more, and already plotting the next trip for when we returned. And return we would.</p>',9),(17,'2011-02-10 21:14:13','2011-04-15 20:36:46',5,8,'South Park Canyon','I was exhausted and felt like I had been wandering lost for hours.

We had not had a proper through-hike for several years, so Dan\r\nhad spread out some maps and the rest of us huddled around, each\r\nsearching out our favorite areas. Dan waxed romantic on the Panamint\r\nRange, so naturally we looked for some canyon that we have not\r\npreviously explored. Greg was interested in revisiting Panamint City\r\nagain. A very good idea. Edric and I had not been there. But as a\r\nthrough hike, it had been done. We were looking for ways of linking\r\nit with some destination other than Johnson Canyon. I was really\r\nexcited about where we were at presently, Butte Valley. I had not\r\nbeen here before and already I wanted to return to it. Then I saw\r\nwhat looked to be an old unpaved road leading up from Panamint Valley\r\ninto something called South Park Canyon. Could we link it to Pamamnt\r\nCity? Possibly, but that route looked longer than long with plenty of\r\nmountain summits and off trail bushwhacking.(1)* I would not want to\r\ntry it in a single day. At the end of South Park Canyon the road\r\nplateaued up at an abandoned airstrip, or at least, that is what the\r\ntopo map said. Was it still there? Was the road still there? It\r\nlooked interesting enough to want to connect the dots. The end of the\r\nairstrip was ringed by high elevation mountain peaks that bordered\r\nButte Valley. And there was a visible gap between two peaks that lead\r\nto a small ridgeline that would descend into Butte Valley, east of\r\nthe magnificent Stripped Butte Rock. Dan kept checking the elevation\r\nlines and started grinning.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I proposed the idea. It would be long, but\r\nnot quite as long as the Panamint City through hike had been. There\r\nwas a trail of some sort, or at least, there had been. It gained a\r\nlot of elevation and hugged some pretty steep canyon walls. If it was\r\nwashed out, it would get bad really quick. However, if it was clearly\r\nmarked and too easy (always a factor you had to calculate in when\r\ndealing with Greg) then the off-trail decent down a steep mountain\r\nridge would make up for it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We batted around a few more ideas but I kept\r\ncoming back to South Park. The factors were weighed: Did it look too\r\neasy? Too short? Was it awesome enough? Was there enough of a\r\npossibility that we could die?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We had more tequila shots and agreed that\r\nthis would be our next targeted hike.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Then I looked at the map again and started\r\nto seriously wonder if I had bitten off more than I could chew.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&ldquo;<em>You hanging in there?&rdquo; Cameron&rsquo;s\r\nface loomed in front of my headlamp, framed by the darkness. He\r\nlooked drawn with fatigue, but focused. I gave him a thumbs up.</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&ldquo;<em>Do you need some goo?&rdquo;</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>I nodded. He took his last small, gold\r\nfoil package out and handed it too me. I tore it open and sucked the\r\nslime down. It would keep me going for a bit more.

There was\r\na feeling that we had done this trip enough times as a group that we\r\nhad the details dialed in. This would be the first trip since 1995\r\nthat the four original members would all be together again. That felt\r\ngood and right. We also had Mark Mooney returning, along with Blake\r\nand Bob Stowell. Cameron brought his dog, Joaquin. Dan brought Jack.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/41/large_thumb/sp_ballarat.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"226\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We made good time down to Ballerat, had our\r\nbeers, and found a flat space to set up camp at the base of the\r\nfour-wheel drive road that ascended the barren Panamnt Range. I kept\r\nlooking up at that road and thinking that, damn, it was steep. Greg\r\ntold me not to worry about it. We had all day tomorrow for that.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There was good camaraderie and Dan conceded\r\nthat it was, indeed, a good idea that Bob brought a table with him to\r\ncook on. Bob, a veteran fisherman, just shook his head quietly with\r\nseeming disbelief that Dan should have ever doubted him in the first\r\nplace. </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A cold wind picked up that night as Greg regaled us with\r\nstories of the Ballarat Bandit (2)*, which we thought was untrue. He\r\nassured us that it was all fact, and that there were warnings all\r\nover the internet about this man. This made us feel felt very\r\nvulnerable, and we all quieted down as the hard desert wind blew\r\nthrough our camp out there in the middle of nowhere. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>I stood stock still as a violent shudder\r\ncoursed through me. I crossed my arms over my chest and hunched over\r\ntrying to generate warmth. My sweat-soaked t-shirt was catching the\r\nbreeze and it felt like it was turning my core to ice. All I wanted\r\nto do was lie down. All around me was nothing but bushes and rocks\r\nand darkness. Even my tiny Petzel headlamp seemed to be losing power.</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t stand still. Keep moving,&rdquo; I\r\nheard Dan&rsquo;s voice behind me.</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>I nodded my head.

SET AN\r\nOPEN COURSE FOR THE VIRRRGIN SEA! </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The recorded sounds of Eric Cartman from\r\nSouth Park shattered the still tranquility of the early morning. Dan\r\nwas blasting his truck&rsquo;s stereo.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&lsquo;CAUSE IIIIII&rsquo;VE GOT TOOO BE FREEEEEEE!\r\nFREE TO FACE THE LIFE THAT&rsquo;S AHEAD OF ME &hellip;!&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It was going to be a long day.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/42/large_thumb/banditbike.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We were cleaning up our breakfast of\r\nblueberry pancakes that Bob had made and were preparing ourselves for\r\nthe hike when Blake wandered off to relieve himself. He came back to\r\nthe trucks and said that he found an abandoned motorbike. We all\r\ntrundled off after him and sure enough, pushed off of the embankment\r\nwe were camped on, was an old off-road bike. Blake wanted to keep it.\r\nDan wanted to report it. I was concerned about time. Greg suggested\r\nthat it was the Ballarat Bandit&rsquo;s. Mark suggested that they would\r\nreturn it to Ridgecrest&rsquo;s sheriff&rsquo;s office. Mark won the day, and\r\nthe beat up bike was roped down onto Bob&rsquo;s truck. (3)*</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The hikers were to be Dan, Cameron, Greg,\r\nand myself. Jack-Dog and Joaquin would join us. Mark, Bob, and Blake\r\nwould transport the bike to Ridgecrest, the head back down Panamint\r\nValley to Goler Wash, drive up that road, over Mengel Pass, and then\r\nfind somewhere to set up camp down in Butte Valley. The prime\r\nlocation would be at the Geologist cabin. If that was taken, then we\r\nwould rely on them to find an appropriate place. Mark would have the\r\nbeers cold and the steaks marinating for us.</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/39/large_thumb/sp_hikestart.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The dogs were fed, our packs were rechecked,\r\nwater bottles were filled, feet were taped up, radio frequencies were\r\ncoordinated, and finally keys were exchanged. Both Bob and Blake\r\nlooked up at the road we were to hike up and told us that we were\r\ncrazy. Mark just told us that he would see us on the other side.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The truth was, as bad and as steep and as\r\nbarren as our path looked, it was a road. A serviceable road. That\r\nmight have disappointed us. I think we had romantic visions of\r\nblazing a trail across the mountains. Yet at the same time, Dan and\r\nGreg and Cameron remembered all too vividly the sheer exhaustion of\r\ndoing just that through Johnson Canyon. So with all that in mind, we\r\ntoasted with tequila, said our farewells, turned our backs to\r\nPanamint Valley, and started our long trudge up the winding road that\r\neventually lead into South Park Canyon. As we gained elevation, the\r\nroad switching back and forth against the mountainside, we watched\r\nthe jeep and the two trucks leave our campsite and disappear in a\r\ntrail of dust for Ridgecrest. Soon all that was left was the wind\r\nbuffeting against our ears. There was no going back now.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><em>Everything was losing focus. My view of the world was a dark\r\ntunnel lit by a dim grey light where fuzzy shapes impeded my path. I\r\ncould hear the dogs. I could hear Cameron ahead of me. I could hear\r\nDan behind me. Greg was so far ahead that I had lost all sense of\r\nhim. He had hit the wall hard just ten or twenty long, long minutes\r\nbefore. He too went into a shivering fit. Now he dropped all\r\npretenses of safety and blasted as fast and as far as he could in a\r\nlast ditch effort to find the summit. I could only hope that he would\r\nfind it.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE CLIMB</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I pushed aside any mental picture I stored\r\nof the trails complete topography and concentrated on leisurely\r\nclimbing the dry, empty road upward. I pretended that this would be\r\nthe hardest part, and that if I could get up this I would be rewarded\r\nby a stretch of flatness. And perhaps the road was not as steep as it\r\nfelt. It was still morning, it was the very first part of the hike,\r\nmy legs were not stretched out and warmed up yet (oh, but they were\r\ngetting that way awfully fast) and I had just eaten. Dan and Cameron\r\nwere setting a good pace and surprisingly it was Greg that hung back\r\nwith me. I was determined not to just power through the trip, I\r\nwanted to enjoy it as much as possible. I would let myself rest a\r\nmoment at a turn in the road and just feel the breeze, or marvel at\r\nthe blueness of the sky; on how parched and white the landscape\r\nlooked in contrast. When you concentrated on it, other colors would\r\nmagically appear: yellows, browns, purples, even shades of green. </span><img src=\"/system/images/43/large_thumb/panamint_lake.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There was a small mire of water on the valley floor (that I learned\r\nafterwards is Panamint Lake) that was clear and still, and it\r\nreflected the sky and the clouds. It looked like a window into\r\nsomething cool and refreshing on the arid valley. I made sure I\r\nenjoyed all of this, but remembered that there were still miles to go\r\nand other sights to be seen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Greg started to wake up and picked up his\r\npace to catch up with Cameron, and it was Dan&rsquo;s turn to play\r\ncaboose with me. He admitted that his knees were hurting, and that he\r\nwas pissed because he did not feel the same after his epic bout with\r\nLymes Disease. He hoped that it would not be a permanent condition.\r\nAlso, Jack-Dog was slowing down. He had a doggy pack that carried\r\nwater, and he was not feeling frisky about it. Dan was saddened by\r\nhis slow pace, and removed the pack and carried it himself. He\r\nadmitted softly that this might indeed be Jack&rsquo;s last hike with us.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Towards the crest of the climb there was an\r\ninsanely steep trail that went straight up, cutting across the\r\nremaining switchbacks. And when I say trail, I mean a four-wheel\r\ndrive track. It was not just insane, it was stupid. How, or even why,\r\nsomeone did that I could not fathom. At the very top there was a rise\r\nthat made the track appear almost perfectly vertical. Cameron, eyes\r\nall bright with a challenge, smiled and said that he would beat Greg\r\nto the top and took off for it at a run. Greg took up the challenge,\r\nand the race was on. If I said that they ran up an eighty-degree\r\nincline it would probably be an exaggeration, but at the angle that\r\nwe were at, that was exactly what it looked like. It was exhausting\r\njust watching. I have to hand it to them both; it took a lot of\r\nstrength to make it up to the top. The last few yards climbing the\r\nrise took its toll on them as we could see on their faces. But they\r\nboth made it with a mixture of self-congratulations, pain, and\r\nfatigue. They rested there, legs trembling, gulping in water and air\r\nand the vista that we were about to turn away from as Dan and I\r\ncaught up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The landscape changed dramatically when we\r\nwere at the base of the canyon. The vast bright, glaring &hellip; sameness\r\n&hellip; was now gone. The mountain was darker with rich veins of\r\ncontrasting rock stratus that wove and bent and curled. Steep cliffs\r\nbroke off with succulents clinging at every niche in extreme angles.\r\nRich shadows streaked across the mountain. Jack and Joaquin found\r\nshade and plopped right down with their tongues lolling out to the\r\nground. We stopped for a water break while Cameron broke out his\r\nsecret weapon.</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/46/large_thumb/hiking.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The goo.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Officially, the goo is called PowerBar\r\nEnergy Gel. And it would save our lives.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">According to the Powerbar website: &ldquo;PowerBar\r\nEnergy Gel is the first gel to provide the carbs and electrolytes of\r\na high end sports drink, and contain 4 times the sodium of leading\r\ncompetitors. Sodium is the key electrolyte lost in sweat and is the\r\nonly electrolyte recommended to be replaced during endurance\r\nexercise.&rdquo;*(4)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Cameron was gracious enough to share, and\r\nafter some gentle ribbing, we all concluded that we needed to bring\r\nsome for ourselves on the next trip.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><em>The stars were intensely bright in the pitch sky. Only they\r\ndifferentiated the blackness of the sky from the blackness of the\r\nmountains. We were all scrambling as quick as we could now. We knew\r\nthe saddle had to be there.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE CANYON</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The hike into the canyon was simple,\r\nrelaxing fun. We were following a road, so there was not any\r\nscrambling over deadfall or boulders. There was some shade, always\r\nshifting from one side of the high walls to the other, depending upon\r\nwhich way our path snaked. It was uphill, and we kept commenting how\r\nit would not be noticeable if it had not been for the climb up to the\r\ncanyon. My legs kept twitching and jerking with fatigue. Greg even\r\nsaid that he just needed a few yards of flatness for relief. We\r\nwalked backwards and sometimes rested, but the constant incline wore\r\nus out. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">While the canyon was beautiful, I remember\r\nit being mostly pleasant. The weather was pleasant. The company was\r\npleasant. Everything was just working on all cylinders. The changes\r\nthat had all happened to us in the last few years were noticeable. My\r\nfriends were becoming the people that they always wanted to be, and\r\nit showed. Dan was coming out of a personal and physical hell and was\r\nnow officially in the fire department. He was itching for stability,\r\nand maybe even a new place to live. He had that look like he wanted a\r\nproject and something to build. Greg was coming out of a downward\r\nspiral that had lasted several years and now seemed on an even keel\r\nand appeared as if he did not want to waste any more of his life\r\naway. He wanted to seriously do something about it. He even had\r\n(gasp!) a career ahead of him. And Cameron was adjusting his life to\r\nembrace more experiences without being socially self-conscious. After\r\nMark Bingham&rsquo;s death on 9/11, he embraced how life was short and\r\nhow it was best not to take himself too seriously. He was training\r\nfor a marathon even. A marathon! He was becoming more interested in\r\nbeing an active participant as opposed to just following someone\r\nelse&rsquo;s lead. As for myself, I now had a child. It was hard to be\r\naway from him, but Dan kept reminding me how much better of a father\r\nI would be if I sought out my own experiences. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We were all tired, but our attitudes kept us\r\nbuoyant. That was the one thread that linked the whole trip together.\r\nThe attitude was terrific.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><em>I looked up and noticed that the night&rsquo;s sky had somehow\r\nchanged. We now could see the outline of the twin peaks we were\r\nheaded up between. The light was changing. Somewhere, far beyond us,\r\nthe moon was rising. This gave me great hope and a new surge of\r\nenthusiasm overcame me.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE CABINS</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The morning slipped into the afternoon, the\r\nsun got hotter, the shadows retreated, and still we climbed. There\r\nwas some discussion as to whether we should have driven, except that\r\nour trail would eventually diverge from the road and lead us off of a\r\nmountainside. But there were tire marks in the road, so we assumed it\r\nwas passable until then.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The topo maps indicated that there were a\r\ncouple of buildings nearby, and sure enough we found them. There was\r\na spring with a water tank and two cabins. But these cabins were not\r\na hundred year old relics. These were cared for, added on to, mended,\r\nand added on to again. Obvious care had gone into them. Cabin Number\r\nOne, as we called it, was built up on a rock against the north side\r\nof the cliff wall. Cabin Two was just a little farther up the canyon\r\nfloor and surrounded by shade trees. (5)*</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So this was where the tire marks had led.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It was the natural place to stop for lunch.</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/45/large_thumb/sp_cabin.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Cabin One had multiple rooms and furnishing\r\nand a wood burning stove. It had a refrigerator and a skylight and\r\nbunk beds and a deck. It was surreal. It was quickly decided that\r\nMark, Blake and Bob had to see the place. The road up to it was\r\nclear, so plans were made that the following day we would drive up\r\nand spend the night here.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Cabin Two was occupied, but we asked the\r\nwoman there if we could check it out anyway. She was very nervous\r\nabout having these strange dirty men invade her place while her\r\nboyfriend was away, so I opted to stay outside. Behind the cabin\r\nsomeone had built an arbor and a garden. It was kind of amazing how\r\nthese buildings were kept furnished and not vandalized. It gave you\r\nhope in people.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We had lunch in the shade by the spring at\r\nthe foot of Cabin One. It was here that Greg was telling Dan that he\r\nshould come to Burning Man that coming August, but Dan was skeptical\r\nof the people. Greg was trying to convince him that they had a really\r\ncool set up and that he wanted to build a bar; you know, something\r\nsimple. Like a lemonade stand. But it had to withstand the wind. Dan\r\nsaid that he would go if he could build it. \"Tell me what you\r\nwant and I\'ll build it for you. I don\'t care what it is; just tell me\r\nand I\'ll do it.\" Greg was hemming and hawing that a dome is the\r\nbest construction against the harsh elements but time ... material\r\n... coordination ... transportation ...and Dan virtually exploded\r\nwith \"That\'s easy! Dude, We could probably build it behind the\r\nfirehouse. Easy. That\'s easy. It\'s the simplest design. So what; we\r\nrent a truck. Dude, we can do this.\"</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Greg went on talking about how cool it could\r\nbe and that we should all come. He had an idea for a theme for the\r\nbar. Since a large group of his friends were really big fans of Buffy\r\nthe Vampire Slayer, it could be a vampire bar. He and Matt had been\r\nexperimenting with higher end makeup and latex prosthetics, and\r\neveryone could dress up &hellip;He started to look embarrassed. He said\r\nthat he bore a resemblance to the character Spike, and that it could\r\nbe called Spike&rsquo;s Vampire Bar. The three of us kind of rolled our\r\neyes, but had to admit that the vampire theme was really in vogue,\r\nand it could draw a crowd. Greg said he didn&rsquo;t care about that. It\r\nwas just an excuse to hang out with his friends and that we should\r\ncome. Besides, he didn&rsquo;t want to have to work too hard at it. Dan\r\nsaid that Greg wouldn&rsquo;t have to work, that he would do it himself.\r\nCam said that he was in if he could swing things. But he might be\r\ngoing on a trip at that time. And I said that I probably could not go\r\nbecause of Griffin. But we both said that we would love to help out.\r\nThen Dan said that it would be built, and it would be the greatest\r\nthing out in the desert and Greg started to look scared. But he was\r\nhappy that Dan was coming out of his funk.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Then I started getting fidgety because we\r\nwere relaxing way too much, and we still had a long hike ahead of us.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&ldquo;<em>Just keep moving. It can&rsquo;t be far\r\nnow.&rdquo; Dan had stopped to check on me. I was lagging far behind now. </em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>I nodded as a reply. It took too much to\r\nanswer.</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Dan looked worried. It was clear he had\r\nhit the wall as well. </em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&ldquo;<em>Go on,&rdquo; I wheezed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay.&rdquo;</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&ldquo;<em>You sure?&rdquo;</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>I nodded again. I wasn&rsquo;t going to sleep\r\nhere tonight. We were going to make it out of here.</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE BRIDGE</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">While the other three were regrouping I\r\nstruck out on my own. I was going slower than the rest, so I figured\r\nif I got a head start I would not hold them back too much.</span></p>\r\n<p>The valley appeared to stop here, and for us to continue onwards\r\nwe had to follow the road which immediately veered to the south side\r\nof the canyon and zigzagged up the steep side and hugged the cliff\r\nface. There at the top the road had washed out. <img src=\"/system/images/47/large_thumb/bridge.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" />However, someone had\r\nbuilt and industrious log bridge to span the gap. It was only\r\napproximately ten yards long but it worked. Someone went through a\r\nlot of time and effort to repair this, and we felt that there was a\r\nlarger story going and that we would like to know more about it.(6)*\r\nAll I knew is that I wouldn&rsquo;t want to attempt crossing it by jeep.\r\nImmediately beyond there was a very sharp, very rocky corner (7)*\r\nwith a bone crushing drop off. It looked very nasty to navigate, but\r\nI assume it has been done.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I used the excuse of waiting for the others\r\nwhile I tried to catch my breath. My allergies were beginning to get\r\nto me, and breathing was a labor.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The road breached the blocked end of the\r\ncanyon and continued to climb into another higher section of the\r\ncanyon. The walls became rockier and narrower and the road&rsquo;s\r\nincline increased. It was starting to get painful, but we trudged\r\nonwards to our next destination, which was Coulter Spring halfway\r\nbetween the bridge and the airstrip. If our luck held out, it would\r\nnot overrun the road with impassable shrubs.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Lady luck was still with us and although it\r\ngot steeper still, the road was clear. Behind us the canyon walls\r\nformed a darkened &lsquo;V&rsquo; with the bright sky as a backdrop. Clouds\r\nwere moving in from the west blocking some of the sun which was\r\nmoving ominously lower towards our backs into the dip if the canyon.\r\nWe knew that we had to quicken our pace, but we were moving just as\r\nfast as we could. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>The tiniest, thinnest strip of white\r\nlight appeared low on the horizon in front of us. It took me a moment\r\nto understand what it was. Then I heard Dan whoop from in front of\r\nme. </em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>It was the moon. </em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>A full moon. </em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>And it was rising directly over the\r\nsaddle of the mountain pass we were looking for.</em></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE AIRSTRIP</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/44/large_thumb/southpark.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"370\" height=\"278\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The sky overhead was still blue, but the\r\nclouds behind us were darkening. The road was leveling. The mountain\r\npeaks were widening out before us. The sun was lower at our backs.\r\nOur shadows began to stretch and lengthen in front of us. And then we\r\ncrested the gentle curving summit of the canyon onto a high\r\nelevation, open plain of scrub grass. We had made it. A fine cool\r\nbreeze and a vast open sky met us. Cloud shadows sped across the vast\r\nexpanse of the field. Directly in our front horizon was the small dip\r\nthat I thought we would use as our exit off of the mountain. The\r\nscene looked more like something that I envisioned as Africa, not\r\nDeath Valley. Something from King Solomon&rsquo;s Mines, perhaps. That is\r\nwhat always impresses me about Death Valley National Park. Every time\r\nI turn around, there is something different. Something wonderful.\r\nMaybe it was just because it was flat, but I loved the airstrip. I\r\nfelt giddy. Or maybe it was just the altitude. Or maybe it was the\r\nfact that my allergies had swollen my bronchial tubes practically\r\nshut.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There was not anything left that could\r\ndenote the plateau as an airstrip. There were a few old dirt roads\r\nthat cris-crossed each other, but that was about it. Greg was a\r\nlittle disappointed. I was a little worried that a flat terrain would\r\nresult in mud. (It had, after all rained the day before) But before\r\nwe plotted our next move, Greg was on the radio trying to contact\r\nMark who was hopefully below us somewhere in Butte Valley. We had\r\nassumed he made it, but in those first few moments of radio attempts\r\nand failures, one starts to wonder. Then worry. But we refused to let\r\nourselves become discouraged. Attitude is everything. And once again,\r\nwe let out a holler of joy when we heard Mark&rsquo;s voice come through\r\nover the speaker. He had made it. Camp was set up and waiting for us.\r\nThey were not able to procure the Geologist cabin, but found instead\r\nan isolated spot for them to spread out in and have some protection\r\nfrom the winds. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Camp was there; al we had to do was go down\r\nto it. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">---</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font color=\"#000000\"><em>That full moon,\r\noutrageously bright, was ever slowly peaking right over the brim of\r\nthe very saddle we were hiking up to. Luna was calling out for us. I\r\ngave out a shout of thanks. The way was lit for us now, like a gift\r\nfrom above</em></font><font color=\"#000000\">.</font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">---</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE RIGHT TURN</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Dan and Greg read and reread the topo maps\r\nagain. After some time they made an executive decision and changed\r\nour course. Instead of heading straight across the airstrip and down\r\nthe pass in front of us, we were to turn right and head south. From\r\nthere we would pick up an old road that would take us close to a pass\r\nbetween two steep peaks. From there a finger of a mountain ridge\r\nwould take us down into Butte Valley closer to Mark&rsquo;s camp, west of\r\nStripped Butte Rock.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I remember Cameron being so excited that he\r\nraced ahead, and then became almost distracted with the way the small\r\npebbles on the ground looked as they sat in the shallow water the\r\nseemed to surround us. The way the light of the sky reflected off of\r\nthe water. The shadows the pebbles cast. It was hypnotic. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We made for the south side of the valley\r\nwith speed. Already the wind was getting cooler and our shadows much\r\ntoo long. We reached the hillside and began searching through the\r\ndense brush and trees for the elusive road. As we found it, I\r\nremember being a little dismayed that it traveled westward, back in\r\nthe direction we had originally came up from South Park Canyon.\r\nBackwards? Really?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I took a picture of Cameron, smiling at the\r\nprospect that we were on the last leg of this long journey. We\r\nregrouped and head back down the road. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><em>A narrow band of silver light was cast from between the peaks,\r\nstraight down the gully to us. And above, the moon, full and pregnant\r\nwith light and energy shone out like a spotlight. Here was the way.\r\nAlmost there now.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The road, which had not been used in a dog&rsquo;s\r\nage and was little more t</span><img src=\"/system/images/48/large_thumb/cam_and_joaquin.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"278\" height=\"370\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">han a trail, slowly edged up the hillside\r\nand then plunged downward into a neighboring valley. A valley? </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I had\r\nthought that it would take us up to the plateau&rsquo;s outer rim so we\r\ncould exit down and out. But no, this was not the case. We went down\r\ninstead, and the trail began to wander here and there without any\r\nintent on going anywhere. Down in the trees with hills on either side\r\nof us, it began to get dark. The winds of evening picked up and the\r\nair began to get cold. All four of us were at the ends of our comfort\r\nlevel, and we were packed for light travel. Sleeves were rolled down.\r\nGloves, if any, came on. And still we wandered aimlessly. Cameron\r\nshared more of his PowerBar goo. We came to a clearing as the trail\r\nmade a sharp bend and turned southward. Finally southward. From here\r\nwe were out of the trees and I could see the sun setting behind the\r\nrim of the peaks. I took a second picture of Cameron, this time with\r\na worried expression on his face. The change in the last twenty\r\nminutes was troubling. And in the next twenty minutes?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The trail began to look like a road again\r\nand slowly made its way up the hillsides once more. As we rose, we\r\nbecame colder. Already at the end of our endurance, we began fighting\r\nfor warmth. Not a good sign. But we kept up the encouragements and\r\nthe momentum. We had to be close now, didn&rsquo;t we?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Dan had his headlamp out now as he kept\r\nrechecking the maps. Greg was scouting way ahead. I was on reserve\r\nenergy now. I kept plodding along, but my pace was slow. We continued\r\nclimbing up. What little I had left was quickly being used up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><em>I heard Greg holler. He had made the crest of the saddle. That\r\nspurred us on even faster. My weary feet were unable to steer myself\r\nstraight, but I didn&rsquo;t mind. All I had to do was follow the light.\r\nThen I heard Cameron&rsquo;s yell of triumph. He has made it too.</em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE TWIN PEAKS</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Greg shouted that he thought he found the\r\ngully that would take us to the correct saddle between the two\r\nintended peaks. The problem was, it was officially getting dark now.\r\nI could not see Greg at all. And all of the peaks began to look the\r\nsame as they started disappearing into the gloom of the evening. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I had caught up with the rest of the group\r\nas they were all huddled over the topo map, slapping their arms and\r\ntrying to stay warm. Earlier there was some confusion as to where the\r\nroad went, and to where we were to diverge from it, but after a\r\nmeeting of the minds we concluded that Greg was correct. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It was obvious that we were reaching our\r\nlimit. We tried to joke about the possibility of sleeping for a few\r\nhours, masking the fact that we were truly considering it. But we\r\nwere so close; we could not stop. Each of us had to reach down deep\r\ninside of ourselves to find the extra energy to make it up this one\r\nlast pass. I kept thinking of an airplane that had run out of fuel. I\r\nhad to switch to my reserve tanks. But by then they were almost\r\ndepleted as well.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Above us, the twin peaks were no more than\r\ntwo black triangles against a darkening sky. The lowest point between\r\nthem was our destination. All we had to do was make it up there.\r\nCameron handed out his PowerBar Gel to us. We shared the last of our\r\nwater. Then we began to stumble up the shallow ravine.</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE SADDLE</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I was so weary when I crested the summit.\r\nThe clear starry night seemed to suck the last remnants of warmth\r\nfrom me. But as soon as I reached the lip of the ridge I was buffeted\r\nby warm breezes coming up from Butte Valley. We congratulated\r\nourselves and gave ourselves a moment of much needed rest. Dan made\r\ncontact with Mark who got in Dan&rsquo;s truck and drove out to the\r\ndesignated pickup spot. He would keep his headlights on as a guild to\r\nus. I have to say, that felt really, really great to hear. We made\r\nsure that each of us understood the route that we were supposed to\r\ntake getting down. With no kidding aside, a false step could end in\r\ndeath. The drop offs on this side of the mountain rim was precarious\r\nand lethal. We checked and rechecked the topo map against the GPS\r\nunits. We stuck together close, within arms reach of each other in\r\ncase someone took a fall. We had come too far to make a mistake now.\r\nIt would be so easy to overestimate our momentum and cause an\r\naccident. So many times before this is where the mistakes were made,\r\nthe last leg of the journey. We joked about Greg twisting his ankle\r\non the last twenty yards of the Panamint through-hike. We would make\r\nsure something like that would not happen now.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Dan calculated that we were a little east of\r\nthe finger ridge that we were to descend. He took Jack-Dog with him\r\nto carefully find the way down. We were close on his heels. </span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE DESCENT</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The moonlight shone silver and gray across\r\nthe shadow striped ridges of the eight hundred foot drop. We\r\noh-so-carefully skirted the rim of the range along the backside of\r\nthe western peak until we came across our ledge. Damn. It was small.\r\nTiny. Steep. We nervously laughed. I clearly remembered pointing and\r\nasking, &ldquo;You want us to go down that?&rdquo; It looked like a diving\r\nboard that sloped out some ten feet then plunged into darkness. GPS\r\nunits were rechecked. Topo maps were referenced. Yup, this was our\r\nroute.</span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/system/images/49/large_thumb/dan.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"278\" height=\"370\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;\" /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Dan and Jack started down. He would prod the\r\nground with a foot to check the steepness before making a step. The\r\nknife-like ridge was not straight and had many branches that led to\r\ndrops. There was no hurrying. We linked arms when necessary. After a\r\nbit the ridge leveled. We had to slowly inspect the crest to see\r\nwhich way led down. I miscalculated directions and went left when I\r\nshould have gone right. It looked as if it was the way down. Oh, it\r\nwent down all right. Straight down. The lip I stepped on petered out\r\nand dropped into nothing. I stopped too abruptly and slid in the\r\nloose rock. Not much, but just enough to have my heart leap into my\r\nthroat. It was all too easy to make a mistake here. I inched my way\r\nback up.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Jack-Dog found the way. Joaquin was right\r\nbehind. They both wanted off the mountain. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">With each drop our mood lightened. We were\r\nstill careful, but we became more and more relaxed. Toward the bottom\r\nwe came across what appeared to be the end of the ridge that ended in\r\na cliff. We had to backtrack and slid down some shale to a lower\r\nlevel. From there we could see the valley floor. The moonlight was\r\nmaking the scrub grass appear gray which unfortunately made the ridge\r\nappear darker. Footing was less sure, but the angle of descent was\r\nleveling out. We scampered down the remaining drop and laughed\r\nuncontrollably as our feet found level ground. We landed right on\r\ntarget. Mark was mere minutes away parked on a dirt road, the trucks\r\nheadlights like a beacon bringing us home. </span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE BEERS</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We were all smiles as we walked proudly to\r\nthe truck and saw Mark silhouetted against the light. I remember him\r\ngreeting each of us in turn as we stepped up to the lip of the road.\r\nHe took our hand, gave us a hug, and put a cold bottle of beer with\r\nlime into our hands, one by one. We leaned against the sideboard and\r\ndrank deeply, laughing and saying things like &ldquo;epic&rdquo; and\r\n&ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo; and &ldquo;glorious&rdquo;. We were a sight to see,\r\ncovered in dust and grime and grinning from ear to ear. Then Mark\r\nasked us the question that I was burning to hear,</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&ldquo;How do you want your steaks cooked?&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We piled into the truck as he radioed in our\r\norders. There he and Bob and Blake had already set up our tents. The\r\nfire was burning and the meat was on the grill. All we had to do was\r\nrelax and enjoy.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<h3 class=\"western\">THE EPILOGUE</h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Dan saved getting injured until the next\r\nmorning. While explaining parts of the hike to the others over\r\ncoffee, Dan stepped backwards and fell over a thorny bush that\r\nboarded our camp. He skewered his toe pretty good. Greg was happy to\r\nuse his medical kit to clean and dress the wound. Go figure.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">We did take the others to the Briggs Cabin\r\nthe next day and spent the night there. I highly recommend it.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Some dude with a flashing yellow light on\r\nhis car seems to patrol South Park Canyon Road. He seems to rip down\r\nthe road at dusk with his light flashing. I do not know anything\r\nabout him except we thought he was annoying.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">If there is one aspect of the hike that I\r\nremember most it was the attitude. It was the binding force that\r\nconnected us. It could have been a miserable experience, but the\r\nbuoyancy of the positive emotions and mutual respect and\r\nencouragement made this one of the best trips ever. I thank each and\r\nevery one of you for that experience..</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">----</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">(1)* I have since found out that the road\r\ndoes connect South Park Canyon with Surprise Canyon:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font color=\"#0000ff\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.trails.com/topomap.aspx?trailid=XFT001-006\"><font style=\"font-size: 13pt;\" size=\"3\">http://www.trails.com/topomap.aspx?trailid=XFT001-006</font></a></span></font></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">(2) * The Ballarat Bandit information:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font color=\"#0000ff\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Aug-29-Sun-2004/news/24590711.html\">http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Aug-29-Sun-2004/news/24590711.html</a></span></font></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font color=\"#0000ff\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.writersbeat.com/showthread.php?t=12976\">http://www.writersbeat.com/showthread.php?t=12976</a></span></font></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Everyone has a different opinion on him.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">(3)* The Ridgecrest Sheriff&rsquo;s Department\r\nconfirmed that the motorbike was stolen by the Ballarat Bandit and\r\nwas used by him to make his way around the Death Valley area.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><font color=\"#000000\">(4)* </font><font color=\"#0000ff\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.powerbar.com/products/36/powerbar-energy-gel.aspx\">http://www.powerbar.com/products/36/powerbar-energy-gel.aspx</a></span></font></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">(5)* Adopt-a-cabin program (from a website)</span></p>\r\n<p>Briggs Cabin is, by far, the most elaborate and best stocked of\r\nall the Adopt-a-Cabins.
